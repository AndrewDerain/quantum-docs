</table><br>
Thank you for accepting our invitation to beta test the Microsoft Quantum Developer Kit preview. Your participation will help the Quantum Architectures and Computation (QuArC) team improve the Microsoft quantum development experience. We hope that this our beta testers will become the nucleus of a quantum development community that will develop new algorithms and techniques that will amaze the industry. You're taking the first step into a new paradigm of computing that promises to push computing power up an exponential curve.

The current documentation includes:
* **Quantum computing concepts** includes topics such the import of linear algebra in quantum computing, the nature and use of a qubit, how to read a quantum circuit, and much more.
* **Installation and configuration** describes how to quickly set up your quantum development environment. Your Visual Studio environment will be enhanced with a compiler for the Q# language and templates for Q# projects and files.
* **Quickstart- your first quantum program**
* **Quantum development techniques**
* **Q# language reference**
* **For more information**
* **API reference**
