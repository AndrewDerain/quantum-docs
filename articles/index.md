# Welcome to the Microsoft Quantum Developer Kit preview *beta*
Thank you for taking the time to try out the Microsoft Quantum Developer Kit preview. You're taking the first step into a new paradigm of computing that promises to push computing power up an exponential curve.

The current documentation includes:
* **Quantum computing concepts** includes topics such the import of linear algebra in quantum computing, the nature and use of a qubit, how to read a quantum circuit, and much more.
* **Installation and configuration** describes how to quickly set up your quantum development environment. Your Visual Studio environment will be enhanced with a compiler for the Q# language and templates for Q# projects and files.
* **Quickstart- your first quantum program**
* **Quantum development techniques**
* **Q# language reference**
* **For more information**
* **API reference**
