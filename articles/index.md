Thank you for accepting our invitation to beta test the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit preview. Your participation will help the Quantum Architectures and Computation (QuArC) team improve the Microsoft quantum development experience. We hope that our beta testers will become the nucleus of a quantum development community that will develop new algorithms and techniques to extend the reach and impact of quantum computing.

Microsoft's Q# language brings new power and flexibility to the art of quantum computing. Q# and it's supporting compiler, libraries, simulators and Visual Studio development environment comprise a significant step toward a more industrial strength computing environment.

Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit preview provides a complete development and simulation environment that's contains the following components:
- Q#
- Q# compiler
- asdf
- asdf

The current documentation includes:
* **Quantum computing concepts** includes topics such as the import of linear algebra in quantum computing, the nature and use of a qubit, how to read a quantum circuit, and much more.
* **Installation and configuration** describes how to quickly set up your quantum development environment. Your Visual Studio environment will be enhanced with a compiler for the Q# language and templates for Q# projects and files.
* **Quickstart- your first quantum program** walks you through how to create the Teleport application in the Visual Studio development environment. You'll learn how to define a Q# operation, call the Q# operation using C#, and how to execute your quantum algorithm. 
* **Quantum development techniques**
* **Q# language reference**
* **For more information**
* **API reference**
