# Support policy for QCI in Azure Quantum

This article describes the Microsoft support policy that applies when you use the QCI provider in Azure Quantum. The article applies to any of the [targets](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers.qci) offered by the QCI provider.

If you're using the QCI provider and experience unexpected issues, you can contact the Azure Support team for help. In some situations, the Azure Support team will need to redirect you to QCI's support team. You may receive a quicker response by reaching out to QCI directly. This article details this process and answers some frequently asked questions.

## Support points of contact

In general, problems using the QCI provider on Microsoft Azure Quantum are best addressed with the Azure Quantum support team directly by [creating an Azure support case](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request). This team has all the necessary details to isolate the issue you're experiencing and direct the report to the right point of contact. The Azure support team also has the means to reach QCI support outside of business hours for the most urgent issues.
