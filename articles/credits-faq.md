# FAQ: Applications to the Azure Quantum Credits Program

## I have questions about Azure Quantum or Azure Quantum Credits and I can't find the answer, how do I get help?
If you have an Azure support subscription, we recommend connecting with [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/#get-support) for the fastest resolution to your question.

If you have any questions regarding the workspace creation process, or any issue using Azure Quantum, bookmark [https://aka.ms/AQ/OfficeHours](https://aka.ms/AQ/OfficeHours) and join our open office hours every Thursday at 8:30am PST.

## Who can apply for the Azure Quantum Credits program?
Educational institutions, companies, and some other approved organizations may apply for Azure Quantum Credits. Applicants may be based in the United States, or in any other market that is currently served by Microsoft Azure. For more information, see the [Azure Quantum Hardware Credit program terms](https://aka.ms/aq/credits/terms).

## What are the terms of use for Azure Quantum Credits?
You can find the terms of use for the Azure Quantum Credits program at this link: [aka.ms/aq/credits/terms](https://aka.ms/aq/credits/terms).

Note that to use Azure Quantum Credits you must also accept the relevant usage terms for Microsoft Azure, as well as the terms from the providers you would like access to.

## How long are credits valid for?
Credits are valid six months from your project start date. Extensions are optionally available on a case-by-case basis.

## How long after I apply will it take to hear back on my application?
We try to respond to all credits applications within one (1) month of the application date.

## What programming languages or frameworks can be used with Azure Quantum and Azure Quantum Credits?
Credits may be used with any programming language or framework that is supported by Azure Quantum. Currently we support:

- Q# ([Quickstart](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.computing))
- Cirq ([Quickstart](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.computing.cirq))
- Qiskit ([Quickstart](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.computing.qiskit))

## My application was rejected. Can I appeal the decision or re-apply?
Rejections may be made for a number of reasons, including the contents of the application or other business reasons, and may not be appealed. In the event of substantial changes to your proposed project, or the group carrying out the project, you may re-apply.

In some cases, your rejection notice may specify that insufficient information was provided to evaluate the application, or note that resources that were linked to in the application were not accessible to reviewers. In this case, you may re-apply to the program while providing more information.

## FAQ: Onboarding and using your credits

### I received my approval notice. What happens next?
Your approval notice will contain a link to an onboarding survey which you will need to fill out completely. Once you have completed the survey, your credits will be made available within two (2) weeks or on the start date of your credits grant, whichever is later.

You will receive a notice once your credits are available to be used, with detailed instruction to do so.

### Are there any costs or charges when using my credits?
There are no costs or charges to using your free credits. However, there may be some small storage costs, as the input and output of your credits jobs are stored in a storage account that you pay for. Job data is typically <1MB per job. For more details, see [Azure Blob Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/).

### How do I see my credits balance?
You can see your current credit balance by selecting the **Overview** blade of your Azure Quantum Workspace, and selecting the **Quota** tab. You will see a credits quota for each provider that you have credits with. The quota lists the total number of credits you have received, and you can hover over the relevant graph to see the amount you have used towards your credits.

You can also see your quotas by using the Azure CLI and the `az quantum workspace quotas` command, as shown in the following example. In this case, the `qgs` row shows that the account has a total of `8333334 qgs` with IonQ, of which `33334 qgs` have been used. The account also has `800 HQC` with Honeywell, of which `0 HQC` have been used.

```bash
$ az quantum workspace quotas -o table
|Dimension | Holds | Limit   |   Period |   ProviderId | Scope  Utilization|
|--------- | ----- | --------- | -------- | ----------|  ------------ | -----------|
|qgs      |  0.0  |  8333334.0 | Infinite | ionq      |  Subscription | 33334.0|
|hqc      |  0.0  |  800.0     | Infinite | honeywell  | Subscription | 0.0|
```

Note that credits are shown in the quota units used by the provider, and not in the dollar value of the credits received. Use the table below to understand the approximate conversion value between quota units and US dollar value:

| Provider | Unit | Approximate $ Value (USD) | Documentation |
|----------|------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Honeywell | HQC (Honeywell Quantum Credit) | $1 USD ~= 0.08 HQC | [Learn more about how Honeywell Quantum Credits are calculated](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers.honeywell) |
| IonQ | QGS (Qubit Gate-Shot) | $1 USD ~= 33,333.3 QGS | [Learn more about how IonQ Qubit-Gate-Shots are calculated](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers.ionq) |

### I'm encountering a problem using my credits. What can I do?
If you are having any problems with Azure Quantum pertaining to credits, or anything else, the best and quickest way to get support is to [file a support ticket with Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/).

If you do not have an Azure support subscription or are unsure about how to file a ticket, you may reply to your approval notice email and one of our team members will get back to you.
