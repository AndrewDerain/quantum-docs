# Setting up the Q# development environment

This section specifies how to create a Q# development environment and validate it by running the teleport sample program.

## Checking prerequisites

If you have [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) 2017 installed, you're ready to install the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit.

If you do not have Visual Studio installed, you can download Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition for free.
1. Go to the [Visual Studio download page](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

1. Click on the Visual Studio Community **Free download** button.

2. Navigate to your browser's download folder and double click on the executable file whose name begins with **vs_community**. The file name will contain a sequence of numbers that varies.

3. _**Important!**_ &nbsp;When you are presented with the option to select the tools for specific workloads, check the boxes for **Universal Windows Platform development** and **.NET desktop development**

4. After selecting your workloads, click **Install** to complete the installation.

## Creating the Q# development environment 

1. Download and install the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit [Visual Studio extension](https://solidrepo.blob.core.windows.net/alpha/latest/QsharpVSIX.vsix). 
Some browsers (IE and Edge) will save this file as `QsharpVSIX.zip`. In that case, rename it to `QsharpVSIX.vsix`.

1. If Visual Studio is open, close it.

1. Start the VSIX installer by double clicking the `QsharpVSIX.vsix` file and follow the prompts to install the extension.

1. Configure Visual Studio to use the QuArC beta NuGet feed. 
    - See [Consume NuGet packages in Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/package/nuget/consume) for the configuration procedure. On that page, you should follow the instructions under the heading **Windows: Add the feed to your NuGet configuration**. The upper section of the page is not required.
    - In the Windows section, the actions occur in Visual Studio (which is not specified.)
    - In step four of the Windows section, you will need the NuGet URL: https://quarcsw.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/alpha/nuget/v3/index.json.
    - _**Important!**_  &nbsp;Ignore step six of the Windows section: "6. If you enabled the nuget.org upstream source, uncheck the nuget.org package source."
    - Ignore the last line of the Windows section (after the image): "Then click here to continue."

## Validating your setup

1. Clone the quantum Libraries repository.
    1. Navigate to the [Libraries](https://quarcsw.visualstudio.com/_git/Libraries).
    2. Click the **Clone** button in the upper right.
    3. In the **Clone repo** pane, click **Clone in Visual Studio**.
    4. If presented with a login request, sign in using your Microsoft credentials.
    5. On the **Visual Studio Team Services** pane, click **Clone** to proceed.

2. Open the `Libraries\QbLibs\QbLibs.sln` solution. 
    - If prompted by the **Install Missing Features** pane, click **Install** to allow the installation of the necessary features. This is most often F# and tools.

4. Validate your Q# environment by running the teleport sample program:
    
   1. Right click on the `Teleportation` project in the Libraries solution, and left click on "Set as Startup Project".
   2. Run the solution (F5.) If teleport runs and the output is as follows, your Q# environment is ready to support your development.

> [!Tip]
> If you receive a number of errors that reference NuGet packages, use the procedures in [NuGet package restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-restore) to restore the packages.
