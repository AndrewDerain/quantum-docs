# The Qubit
If bits are the fundamental object in classical computing then qubits (quantum bits) are the fundamental object of quantum computing.  
 To understand this correspondence, lets look at the simplest example: a single qubit. 

## Representing a qubit ##

While a bit, or binary digit, can be either $0$ or $1$, a qubit can be either of these or a quantum superposition of $0$ and $1$.
The state of a single qubit can be described by a two-dimensional column vector of unit norm. This vector, called the quantum state vector, holds all the information needed to describe the one-qubit quantum system just as a single bit holds all of the information needed to describe the state of a binary variable.

Any two-dimensional column vector of real or complex numbers with norm $1$ represents a qubit. Thus $\begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\\\  \beta \end{bmatrix}$ represents a qubit if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers satisfying $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$. Some examples of valid quantum state vectors representing qubits include $$\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\  0 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\  1 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\\\  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\\\  \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}, \text{ and }\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\\\  \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}.$$

The quantum state vectors $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\  0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\  1 \end{bmatrix}$ take a special role.  These two vectors form a basis for the vector space that describes the qubit's state.  This means that any quantum state vector can be written as a sum of these basis vectors. Specifically, the vector $\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\  y \end{bmatrix}$ can be written as $x \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + y \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\  1 \end{bmatrix}$.  While any rotation of these vectors would serve as a perfectly valid basis for the qubit we choose to privilege this one by calling it the computational basis.  This appellation is earned because of the way we choose two interpret these specific vectors.  We take these two quantum states to correspond to the two states a classical bit can take.  The standard convention is to choose
\begin{equation}
0\equiv \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\  0 \end{bmatrix}\qquad 1 \equiv \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\  1 \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
although the opposite choice could have equally well been taken.  Thus out of the infinite number of possible single qubit quantum state vectors, only two correspond to states of classical bits and all other quantum states do not.

## Measuring a Qubit
Now that we know how to represent a qubit, we can gain some intuition for what these states represent by discussing the concept of a measurement. A measurement corresponds to the informal idea of ``looking'' at a qubit, which immediately collapses the quantum state to one of the two classical states  $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\  1 \end{bmatrix}$ or  $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\  0 \end{bmatrix}$. When a qubit given by the quantum state vector  $\begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\\\  \beta \end{bmatrix}$ is measured, we obtain the outcome $0$ with probability $|\alpha|^2$ and the outcome $1$  with probability $|\beta|^2$. On outcome $0$, the qubit's new state is $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\  1 \end{bmatrix}$, and on outcome $1$ its state is $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\  0 \end{bmatrix}$. Note that these probabilities sum up to $1$ because $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.

The properties of measurement also mean that the overall sign of the quantum state vector is irrelevant. Negating a vector is equivalent to $\alpha \rightarrow -\alpha$ and $\beta \rightarrow -\beta$.  Because the probability of measuring $0$ and $1$ depends on the magnitude squared of the terms, inserting such signs does not change the probabilities whatsoever.  Such phases are commonly called ``global phases'' and more generally can be of the form $e^{i \phi}$ rather than just $\pm 1$.

A final important property of measurement is that it does not necessarily damage all quantum state vectors.  If we start with a qubit in the state $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\  0 \end{bmatrix}$, which corresponds to the classical state $0$, measuring this state will always yield the outcome $0$ and leave the quantum state unchanged.  In this sense, if we only have classical bits (i.e. qubits that are either $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\  0 \end{bmatrix}$ or $\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\  1 \end{bmatrix}$ then measurement does not damage the system.  This means that we can replicate classical data and manipulate it on a quantum computer just as one could do on a classical computer.  The ability, however, to store information in both states at once is what elevates quantum computing beyond what is possible classically.

## Visualizing qubits and transformations using the Bloch sphere ##

For the more visually inclined, qubits can be pictured in $3$D using the Bloch sphere representation.  The Bloch sphere for gives a way of describing a single qubit quantum state (which is a two dimensional complex vector) as a three dimensional real-valued vector.  This is important because it allows us to visualize single-qubit states and thereby develop reasoning that can be invaluable to develop an understanding of multi-qubit states (where sadly the Bloch sphere representation breaks down).  The bloch sphere can be visualized as follows:

The arrows in this diagram show the direction that the quantum state vector is pointing and each transformation of the arrow can be thought of as a rotation about one of the cardinal axes.
While thinking about a quantum computation as a sequence of rotations is a powerful intuition, it is challenging to use this intuition to design and describe algorithms.  Q# from this perspective alleviates this issue by providing a language for describing such rotations.

## Single Qubit Operations

Quantum computers process data by applying a universal set of quantum gates that can emulate any rotation of the quantum state vector.  This notion of universality is akin to the notion of universality for traditional (i.e. classical) computing where a gate set is considered to be universal if every transformation of the input bits can be performed using a finite length circuit.  

In quantum computing, the valid transformations that we are allowed to perform on a quantum bit are unitary transformations and measurement.
The *adjoint operation* or the conjugate transpose is of crucial importance to quantum computing because it is needed to invert quantum transformations.  Q# reflects this by providing methods to automatically compile gate sequences to for the adjoint of a unitary operation, which saves the programmer from having to hand code adjoints in many cases.

There are only four functions that map one bit to one bit on a classical computer.  There are an infinite number of unitary transformations on a single qubit on a quantum computer. Therefore no finite set of primitive quantum operations, called gates, can exactly replicate the infinite set of unitary transformations allowed in quantum computing.  This means, unlike classical computing, it is impossible for a quantum computer to implement every possible quantum program exactly using a finite number of gates.  Thus quantum computers cannot be universal in the same sense that classical computers are.  As a result, when we say that a set of gates is universal for quantum computing we actually mean something slightly weaker than we mean with classical computing.
We require that a quantum computer only *approximate* every unitary matrix within a finite error using a finite length gate sequence.
In other words, a set of gates is a universal gate set if any unitary transformation can be approximately written as a product of gates from this set. We require that for any prescribed error bound, there exist gates $G_{1}, G_{2},\ldots, G_N$ from the gate set such that
$$
G_N G_{N-1} \cdots G_2 G_1 \approx U.
$$
Note that because the convention for matrix multiplication is to multiply from right to left the first gate operation in this sequence, $G_N$, is actually the last one applied to the quantum state vector.  More formally, we say that such a gate set is universal if for every error tolerance $\epsilon>0$ there exists $G_1,\ldots, G_N$ such that  the distance between $G_N\ldots G_1$ and $ U$ is at most $\epsilon$. Ideally the value of $N$ needed to reach this distance of $\epsilon$ should scale poly-logarithmically with $1/\epsilon$.

What does such a universal gate set look like in practice?  The simplest such gate set consists of only two gates: the Hadamard gate $H$ and the so-called $T$-gate (also known as the $\pi/8$ gate):
$$
H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\  1 &-1  \end{bmatrix},\qquad T=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\  0 & e^{i\pi/4} \end{bmatrix}.
$$
However, for practical reasons related to quantum error correction it is more convenient to consider a larger gate set that could be generated using $H$ and $T$ if one desired.  These gates are broken into two categories: Clifford gates and the $T$-gate.  This subdivision is useful because in many quantum error correction schemes Clifford gates are easy to implement whereas non-Clifford gates are quite costly.  The standard set of single-qubit Clifford gates that are included by default in Q# include
$$
H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\  1 &-1  \end{bmatrix} ,\qquad S =\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\  0 & i \end{bmatrix}= T^2,\qquad X=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &1 \\\\  1& 0 \end{bmatrix}= HT^4H,
$$
$$
Y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\  i & 0 \end{bmatrix}=T^2HT^4  HT^6, \qquad Z=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\\\ 0&-1 \end{bmatrix}=T^4.
$$
Here the operations $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are used especially frequently and are named Pauli operators after their creator Wolfgang Pauli.  Together with the non-Clifford gate, the $T$-gate, these operations can be composed to approximate any unitary transformation on a single qubit.

As an example of how unitary transformations can be built from these primitives, the three transformations pictured in the Bloch-spheres above correspond to the gate sequence $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\  0 \end{bmatrix} \mapsto HZH \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\  0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\  1 \end{bmatrix}$.  

While the previous constitute the most popular primitive gate for describing operations on the logical level of the stack, it is often convenient to consider less basic operations at the algorithmic level.  Fortunately, Q# also has methods programmed for implementing them which allows high-level algorithms to be implemented without explicitly decomposing everything down to Clifford and $T$-gates.  The simplest such primitive is the single qubit rotation.  There are three rotations that are usually considered: $R_x$, $R_y$ and $R_z$.  For example, to visualize the action of the rotation $R_x(\theta)$ imagine pointing your thumb along the direction of the $x$-axis of the Bloch-sphere and rotating the result through an angle of $\theta/2$ radians.  This confusing factor of $2$ arises from the fact that orthogonal vectors are $180^\circ$ apart when plotted on the Bloch-sphere but are actually $90^\circ$ degrees apart geometrically.   The corresponding unitary matrices are:
$$
R_z(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix} e^{-i\theta/2} & 0\\\\  0& e^{i\theta/2} \end{bmatrix},\qquad R_x(\theta) = H R_z(\theta) H, \qquad R_y(\theta) = SHR_z(\theta)HS^\dagger.
$$
Just as any three rotations can be combined together to perform an arbitrary rotation in three dimensions, it is obvious from the Bloch sphere representation that any unitary matrix can be written as a sequence of three rotations as well.  Specifically, for every unitary matrix $U$ there exists $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta$ such that $U= e^{i\alpha} R_x(\beta)R_z(\gamma)R_x(\delta)$.  Thus $R_z(\theta)$ and $H$ also form a universal gateset although it is not a discrete set because $\theta$ can take any value. For this reason, and due to applications in quantum simulation, these continuous gates are crucial for quantum computation even though they will ultimately be compiled into discrete gate sequences that closely approximates these rotations.
