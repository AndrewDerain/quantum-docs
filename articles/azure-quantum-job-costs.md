# Azure Quantum Job Costs
This article provides documentation on understanding the cost of jobs in Azure Quantum. 

## Before you start: Understanding job pricing

## After you run: Job Cost Reporting
After you run a job, Azure Quantum makes available detailed pricing information for supported providers. You can use this information to understand the cost of individual jobs.

To review job costs, navigate to the **Job Management** blade within your Azure Quantum Workspace. In the job list, you will see estimated costs reported for each job you've run (where supported). To see more information, click on a job that shows pricing information.

> Note: Some Azure Quantum providers do not support reporting per-job costs, however you can still see your current bill **TODO: Link to section with instructions for reviewing customers total bill for providers.**

Within the Job Details pane, you will see a job cost table with a breakdown of the charges for the job.
