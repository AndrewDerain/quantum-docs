# Get started with a Jupyter notebook and Qiskit in Azure Quantum

Learn how to run Python code that use the Qiskit library in a Jupyter notebook with [Azure Quantum](xref:microsoft.quantum.azure-quantum-overview). A [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook is a document that contains both rich text and code and can run in your browser, and can run Q# and Python code with Azure Quantum.

In this article, you will run a sample notebook that sends a basic quantum circuit expressed using the Qiskit library to an IonQ target via the Azure Quantum service. Qiskit is an open-source framework for working with noisy quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and algorithms. For more information about Quiskit, see the [Qiskit documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/intro_tutorial1.html).

For more information about Jupyter notebooks, see [Run Jupyter notebooks in an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.notebooks).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need the following prerequisites to use Jupyter notebooks in an Azure Quantum workspace.

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An Azure Quantum workspace. See [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).

## Get sample notebook

To get started, copy the sample notebook from the notebook gallery.

1. Select your Azure Quantum workspace in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **Jupyter Notebooks**.
1. Select **Notebook Gallery**.
1. Select the **Qiskit and IonQ** notebook , and select **Copy to My Notebooks**.

The sample notebook can be found under **My Notebooks** and you can now run the notebook.

## Run notebook

To run the Jupyter notebook, follow these steps.

1. Select your Azure Quantum workspace in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **Jupyter Notebooks**.
1. Select the **qiskit-ionq** notebook in **My Notebooks**.
1. Select the cell you want to run and select the **run icon** to execute the code in the cell, or select **Run all** to run all cells in the notebook.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-run-notebooks-workspace/run-notebook.png" alt-text="Run a Jupyter notebook.":::

    The notebook first imports the required packages for the sample, then connects to the Azure Quantum service, and then runs a simple Qiskit circuit.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have any questions regarding the workspace creation process or run into any issue at any point using Azure Quantum, bookmark [Azure Quantum office hours](https://aka.ms/AQ/OfficeHours) and join our open office hours every Thursday 8âˆ¶30 AM Pacific Standard Time zone (PST).
