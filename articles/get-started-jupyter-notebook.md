# Get started with Q# and an Azure Quantum notebook

[!INCLUDE [Azure Quantum credits banner](~/includes/azure-quantum-credits.md)]

Learn how to run Q# code in a Jupyter notebook in the [Azure Quantum](xref:microsoft.quantum.azure-quantum-overview) portal. A [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook is a document that contains both rich text and code and can run in your browser, and can run Q# and Python code in Azure Quantum.  Notebooks can be created directly in the Azure Quantum portal, and offer features such as preloaded connection information and standard Q# libraries. 

In this article, you will run a sample notebook on Azure Quantum that executes a simple quantum random number generator written in Q# and Python. 

For more information about using Jupyter notebooks with Azure Quantum, see [Run Jupyter notebooks in an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.notebooks).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need the following prerequisites to use Jupyter notebooks in an Azure Quantum workspace.

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An Azure Quantum workspace. See [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).

## Copy a sample notebook

To get started, copy a sample notebook from the notebook gallery.

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select your Azure Quantum workspace.
1. Select **Notebooks**.
1. In the **Sample gallery**, locate the **Hello, world: Q#** notebook tile, select either the **IonQ** or **Quantinuum** provider (the sample code is identical) and select **Copy to my notebooks**.
1. The sample notebook can be found under **My notebooks** and you can now run the notebook.

## Run the notebook

To run the sample notebook, follow these steps for your selected provider.

### [IonQ](#tab/tabid-ionq)

1. In **My notebooks**, select the **hello-world-qsharp-ionq** notebook. 
1. To run the full program from top to bottom, select **Run all**. 
1. To walk through the example and run each cell individually from top to bottom, select the cell you want to run and select the **run icon**.

### Stepping through the program on IonQ

The *hello world* program runs a simple quantum random number generator and displays a histogram of the results. 

Some things to note:

- **The kernel**: In the upper right of the notebook, you can see that the notebook is running the **Python 3 (ipykernel)** kernel, which is the default Python shell for Juptyer Notebooks. When you create a notebook in Azure Quantum, you can select either the **Python 3 (ipykernel)** or the **Azure Quantum Q#** kernel. Both kernels are fully compatible with Q# code. 
- **1st cell**: Preloads your subscription information to connect to the Azure Quantum service. 
- **2nd cell**: Retrieves the available targets (quantum computers and simulators) in your workspace. 
- **3rd and 4th cells**: The Q# code that defines the program. Note the *%%qsharp* magic command which allows you to enter Q# code directly into the notebook when using the **Python 3 (ipykernel)**. 
- **5th cell**: Sets the target and submits the job. 
- **6th and 7th cells**: Plots and displays the result. The results should be roughly split between 0 and 1. 

### [Quantinuum](#tab/tabid-qunatinuum)

1. In **My notebooks**, select the **hello-world-qsharp-quantinuum** notebook. 
1. To run the full program from top to bottom, select **Run all**. 
1. To walk through the example and run each cell individually from top to bottom, select the cell you want to run and select the **run icon**.

### Stepping through the program on Quantinuum

The *hello world* program runs a simple quantum random number generator and displays a histogram of the results. 

Some things to note:

- **The kernel**: In the upper right of the notebook, you can see that the notebook is running the **Python 3 (ipykernel)** kernel, which is the default Python shell for Juptyer Notebooks. When you create a notebook in Azure Quantum, you can select either the **Python 3 (ipykernel)** or the **Azure Quantum Q#** kernel. Both kernels are fully compatible with Q# code. 
- **1st cell**: Preloads your subscription information to connect to the Azure Quantum service.

- **3rd and 4th cells**: The Q# code that defines the program. Note the *%%qsharp* magic command which allows you to enter Q# code directly into the notebook when using the **Python 3 (ipykernel)**. 
- **5th cell**: Sets the target and submits the job. 
- **6th and 7th cells**: Plots and displays the result.

Looking at the histogram, you may notice that the program returned 0 every time, which is not very random. This is because the notebook was prepopulated to use the **Honeywell API Validator**, *honeywell.hqs-lt-s1-apival*. Using the API Validator ensures that your code will run successfully on Quantinuum hardware, but also returns 0 for every quantum measurement. 

To create a true random number generator, modify the code in the 5th cell to use the **System Model H1 Emulator** target, *honeywell.hqs-lt-s1-sim*

> [!NOTE]
> Running the program against the H1 Emulator or the System Model H1 computer will use H1 Quantum Credits (HQC) from your account. A single run of this example program costs approximately 5.3 HQC.

```python
qsharp.azure.target("honeywell.hqs-lt-s1-sim")
```

Re-run that cell and the following cells. Now, the results should be roughly split between 0 and 1.
