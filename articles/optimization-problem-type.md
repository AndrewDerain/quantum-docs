# Quantum optimization ProblemType

[!INCLUDE [QIO deprecation warning](includes/qio-deprecate-warning.md)]

## ProblemType

```py
from azure.quantum.optimization import ProblemType
```

The `ProblemType` enum allows you to specify the type of optimization problem
you would like to solve.

### ProblemType.pubo

A polynomial unconstrained binary optimization problem (PUBO) is a problem of
the form:

$$H = \sum_{i} c_{i} x_{i} + \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} x_{i} x_{j} + \sum_{i,j,k}
c_{i,j,k} x_{i} x_{j} x_{k} \text{ where } c_{i,j,k} \in R \text{ and }
x_{i,j,k} \in [0, 1]$$

Where *H* is the cost function, also known as the Hamiltonian. It is called
*k*-local if the maximum degree of the polynomial is *k*.

### ProblemType.ising

An Ising Model is a cost function of the form:

$$H = \sum_{i} c_{i} s_{i} + \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} s_{i} s_{j} + \sum_{i,j,k}
c_{i,j,k} s_{i} s_{j} s_{k} \text{ where } c_{i,j,k} \in R \text{ and }
s_{i,j,k} \in [-1, 1]$$

It is called *k*-local if the maximum degree of the polynomial is *k*.

### Grouped terms

Both problem types support grouped terms. If grouped terms are included in the cost function, use `ProblemType.pubo_grouped` or `ProblemType.ising_grouped`. 
The SDK will adjust the problem type automatically used once a grouped term is added.

> [!NOTE]
> Only a subset of optimization solvers currently support grouped terms.
> Refer to the [`SlcTerm`](xref:microsoft.quantum.optimization.slc-term) documentation for details.
