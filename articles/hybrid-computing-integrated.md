# Integrated quantum computing

- Description
- Exponential reduction in shots
- quantum machine
  - arbitrary control flow and loops
  - classical computations by back end while qubits still alive
  - mid-circuit measurement
  - qubit re-use
  - powered by QIR and Q#

## Examples

### Nested conditionals 

### Mid-circuit measurement

### Qubit re-use 

### Looping with statically bounded iteration counts 

### Classical function calls 

## Supported hardware

### Quantinuum

## Cost estimation


## Next steps
