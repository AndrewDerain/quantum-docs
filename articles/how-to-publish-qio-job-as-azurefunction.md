# Publish a QIO job as an Azure Function

Learn how to deploy your [quantum inspired optimization (QIO)](xref:microsoft.quantum.optimization.concepts.overview.introduction) job as a web service. You'll accomplish this task by using an Azure Function that can be called via a web API. The function receives input via a request URL or a request body. It then calls an Azure Quantum optimization solver and returns the result as a JSON string.

You can make your QIO job and its functionality available to other developers, who will be able to integrate it into their classic code. This integration can be possible without any further knowledge of quantum concepts or QDK libraries. One method for exposing the QIO functionality for that purpose is via an Azure Function that can be called via a web API.

Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to host your functionality in Azure without worrying about underlying infrastructure. For more information, see [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).

The QIO job that will be published as an Azure Function implements what is called the *number partitioning problem*. It splits a given set of integer numbers into two subsets with an equal (or very close) sum of their elements. For more information about this problem and its implementation, see [Solve optimization problems by using quantum-inspired optimization](/training/modules/solve-quantum-inspired-optimization-problems/).

To learn how to deploy a Q# job as a web service using Azure Functions, see [Publish a Q# job as an Azure Function](xref:microsoft.quantum.publish-qc-as-azure-function).

## Prerequisites

You need the following configuration to complete the steps in this article.

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you donâ€™t have an Azure account, register for free and sign up for a [pay-as-you-go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go).
- An Azure Quantum workspace in your Azure subscription. To create a workspace, see [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).
- The latest version of the [Quantum Development Kit for Python](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview).
- The [Azure Functions Core Tools](/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) version 3.x.
- [Python versions that are supported by Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/supported-languages#languages-by-runtime-version).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on one of the [supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms).
- The [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) for Visual Studio Code.
- The [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) for Visual Studio Code, which is also available as part of the [Azure Tools extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack).

## Create a new Azure Function project

First, use Visual Studio Code to create a local Azure Functions project in Python. Later, you'll publish your function code to Azure.

1. Select the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Workspace (local)** area, select the **+** icon, and choose **Create Function...** in the dropdown. When prompted, choose **Create new project...**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-publish-qio-job-as-azurefunction/create-new-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing how to create a new Azure Function project.":::

1. Select a directory location for your project workspace and choose **Select**.
1. Provide the following information at the prompts:

    - **Select a language for your function project**: Choose `Python`
    - **Select a Python interpreter to create a virtual environment**: Choose **Skip virtual environment**
    - **Select a template for your project's first function**: Choose `HTTP trigger`.
    - **Provide a function name**: Type `SplitWeights`.
    - **Authorization level**: Choose `Anonymous`, which enables anyone to call your function endpoint. To learn about authorization levels (and ways for restricting access to your Function), see [Authorization keys](/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#authorization-keys).
    - **Select how you would like to open your project**: Choose `Open in current window`.

1. Using this information, Visual Studio Code generates an Azure Functions project with an HTTP trigger, which means that the function will be callable via an HTTP RESTful API. You can view the local project files in the Explorer window. To learn more about the files that are created, see [Generated project files](/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-vs-code#generated-project-files).

## Test the Azure Function in your local environment

Even though the function doesn't do much yet, this is a good time to test the basic function configuration.
> [!TIP]
> It's good practice to test the function after each of the following steps to ensure that your changes didn't break anything. As you proceed, you should change the request parameters appropriately.

1. To call your function, press **F5** to start the project. Your app starts in the **Terminal** panel and displays the output as it loads. You can see the URL endpoint of your HTTP-triggered function running locally.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-publish-qio-job-as-azurefunction/run-azure-function-locally-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to run the Azure Function locally in the Visual Studio Code terminal.":::

    If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set to **WSL Bash**.

1. Select the Azure icon in the Activity bar and select **Workspace (local)**. You may need to select the **Refresh** icon if nothing appears below it. Expand **Local Project > Functions**, right-click the **SplitWeights** function and select **Execute Function Now...**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-publish-qio-job-as-azurefunction/run-azure-function-locally-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to call the Azure function.":::

1. In **Enter request body** at the top of VS Code, note the request message body value of **{ "name": "Azure" }**. Press **Enter** to send this request message to your function.
1. When the function executes locally and returns a response, a notification is displayed. Information about the function execution is shown in **Terminal** panel.
1. Press **Ctrl + C** to stop the Azure Functions Core Tools and disconnect the debugger.

## Reference Azure Quantum libraries

By default, the generated Azure Functions project only references standard Python libraries. All other libraries needed for the specific function must be referenced explicitly. These references tell the Azure Functions runtime which libraries to load when a function is called. For this function, you'll add a reference to the Azure Quantum Python library.

1. In the project folder, select the file **requirements.txt** to edit it.
1. After the **azure-functions** reference, add a reference to the Azure Quantum Python library **azure-quantum**. The complete file should now look as follows:

    ```python
    # DO NOT include azure-functions-worker in this file
    # The Python Worker is managed by Azure Functions platform
    # Manually managing azure-functions-worker may cause unexpected issues

    azure-functions
    azure-quantum
    ```

1. Save the file.

## Add a reference to your Azure Quantum workspace

You now have a function that can access necessary Azure Quantum libraries when being called via HTTP. But so far, the function doesn't do much. To change that, add a reference to your Azure Quantum workspace.

1. In the project folder, open the file **\_\_init\_\_.py** located in the **SplitWeights** folder. This file contains the code that is executed when an HTTP request is received.
1. Add a reference to your Azure Quantum workspace.  Copy and paste the following code after the last `import` statement. 

    ```python
    from azure.quantum import Workspace
    
    workspace = Workspace (
        subscription_id = "",  # Add your subscription_id
        resource_group = "",   # Add your resource_group
        name = "",             # Add your workspace name
        location = ""          # Add your workspace location (for example, "eastus")
        )
    ```

1. Add your Azure Quantum workspace information. From your Azure portal home page, select your quantum workspace resource. From the overview page, you can hover over each value and copy it to the clipboard. The import and workspace definition should now look like this:

    ```python
    import logging
    
    import azure.functions as func
    
    from azure.quantum import Workspace
    
    workspace = Workspace (
        subscription_id = "123456789",      # Add your subscription_id
        resource_group = "MyResourceGrp",   # Add your resource_group
        name = "MyWorkspaceName",           # Add your workspace name
        location = "MyLocation"             # Add your workspace location (for example, "eastus")
        )
    ```

1. Save the file.

## Add the QIO algorithm code

So far, you've prepared the function to load the necessary Python libraries and create a connection to your Azure Quantum workspace. Now it's time to add some useful optimization code.

1. Add the necessary `import` statements at the beginning. Add the following line after the `import logging` statement.

    ```python
    import json
    ```

1. Add the following statements after the `from azure.quantum import Workspace` statement.

    ```python
    from typing import List
    from azure.quantum.optimization import Problem, ProblemType, Term
    from azure.quantum.optimization import QuantumMonteCarlo
    ```

1. Replace the existing `main` function with following code:

    ```python
    def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
        mineralWeights = []
    
        # Try to read the mineralWeights from the URL-string.
        mwStr = req.params.get('mineralWeights')
        if mwStr:
            list = mwStr.split (",")
            for i in list:
                mineralWeights.append(int(i))
        else:
            # If not passed via URL, try to extract the mineral Weights from the request body.
            try:
                req_body = req.get_json()
            except ValueError:
                pass
            else:
                mineralWeights = req_body.get('mineralWeights')
        
        if mineralWeights:
            # Create a problem for the given list of minerals:
            problem = createProblemForMineralWeights(mineralWeights)
    
            # Instantiate a solver to solve the problem.
            solver = QuantumMonteCarlo(workspace, sweeps = 2, trotter_number = 10, restarts = 72, seed = 22, beta_start = 0.1, transverse_field_start = 10, transverse_field_stop = 0.1)
    
            # Optimize the problem
            result = solver.optimize(problem)
            
            return func.HttpResponse(
                 json.dumps(result['configuration']),
                 status_code=200
            )
        else:
            return func.HttpResponse(
                 "The function couldn't be executed successfully. Pass a mineralWeights param in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.",
                 status_code=400
            )

    def createProblemForMineralWeights(mineralWeights: List[int]) -> Problem:
        terms: List[Term] = []
    
        # Expand the squared summation
        for i in range(len(mineralWeights)):
            for j in range(len(mineralWeights)):
                if i == j:
                    # Skip the terms where i == j as they form constant terms in an Ising problem and can be disregarded.
                    continue
    
                terms.append(
                    Term(
                        c = mineralWeights[i] * mineralWeights[j],
                        indices = [i, j]
                    )
                )
    
        # Return an Ising-type problem
        return Problem(name="Freight Balancing Problem", problem_type=ProblemType.ising, terms=terms)
    ```

Your function now contains two function definitions. The `main` function is executed when an HTTP request is received. It parses the request and looks at the request URL. If a `mineralWeights` parameter is found in the URL, these weights are processed. If the URL doesn't contain this parameter, the request body is analyzed. If a `mineralWeights` parameter is found in the body, these weights are processed. Weights are passed to the `createProblemForMineralWeights` function that creates an Azure Quantum `Problem` object. The `main` function passes this `Problem` object to an Azure Quantum solver and returns the results.

## Prepare your Azure environment

You can now prepare the Azure target environment that will host the function. Preparation includes the creation of an empty Azure Function App and granting it access to your Azure Quantum workspace.

### Create a Function App resource

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in to your Azure account.
1. Select **Create a resource** from the portal menu in the upper left.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-publish-qio-job-as-azurefunction/prepare-cloud-env-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to create a new resource in Azure portal.":::

1. Search for **Function App** and select **Create**.
1. Provide the following information:

    - **Subscription**: Choose the subscription to use. Use the subscription that contains your Azure Quantum workspace.
    - **Resource Group**: Choose the resource group that also contains your Azure Quantum workspace.
    - **Function App name**: Enter a globally unique name for the Function App. The name must be valid in a URL path. The name is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions.
    - **Publish**: Select `Code`.
    - **Runtime stack**: Select `Python`.
    - **Version**: Choose the version of Python you've been running on locally. You can use the `python --version` command to check your version.
    - **Region**: Choose the region where your Azure Quantum workspace is located.

    Leave the default values for **Operating system** and **Plan**, and select **Review + Create** to confirm your input.
1. Validate your input and select **Create**. Deployment will take a few seconds.
1. When the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource** to navigate to your Function App.

### Allow the Function App to access your Azure Quantum workspace

Next, you'll configure a managed identity for the Function App. A managed identity allows the Function App to access other Azure resources, such as the Azure Quantum workspace.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Function App page and select **Identity**, set **Status** to **On** and then select **Save** and **Yes**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-publish-qio-job-as-azurefunction/prepare-cloud-env-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the identity pane showing how to create a managed identity for the Function App.":::

1. Navigate to your Azure Quantum workspace (**Home** -> **Resources**) and select **Access control (IAM)** from the left menu. Select **Add** and **Add role assignment**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-publish-qio-job-as-azurefunction/prepare-cloud-env-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Access control pane showing how to create a new role assignment on your Azure Quantum workspace.":::
    > [!NOTE]
    > You must have Owner or RBAC administrator rights to add role assignment. Otherwise the options under *Add* will appear as disabled.

1. On the **Add role assignment** page, select **Contributor** and select **Next**.
1. On the **Members** tab, in **Assign access to**, select **Managed Identity**, and then select **+ Select members**.
1. In the **Managed identity** dropdown, select **Function App**. 
1. Select the Function App you created earlier and choose **Select**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-publish-qio-job-as-azurefunction/prepare-cloud-env-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select the Function App as a Contributor to your Azure Quantum workspace.":::

1. Select **Next** and then select **Review and assign**.

## Deploy the Azure Function to the cloud

In this step, you'll deploy your function code to the Azure Function App you just created.

1. In Visual Studio Code, select the Azure icon in the Activity bar, and expand **Workspace (local)**.  Select the **Deploy...** icon and then select **Deploy to Function App...**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-publish-qio-job-as-azurefunction/deploy-function-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing how to deploy the Azure Function.":::

1. At the prompt, select your Azure subscription, if applicable, and then select the Function App that you previously created.
1. A notification is displayed after your function is deployed. Select **View Output** to display the status information and the URL that you can use to call the function.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-publish-qio-job-as-azurefunction/deploy-function-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a notification after successful deployment of the Azure function in Visual Studio Code.":::

## Call your QIO algorithm via the Azure Function

You can now test the function by using the direct URL or by passing the parameters within the request body.

### Call the function with its URL

1. Enter the following URL (or copy and paste the URL from the deployment window in the previous step) into your browser:

    ```text
    https://<your_function_app_name>.azurewebsites.net/api/splitweights
    ```

    This call should generate following output:

    ```text
    The function couldn't be executed successfully. Pass a mineralWeights param in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.
    ```

1. Now, call the function again by entering the function URL with the required parameters.

    ```text
    https://<your_function_app_name>.azurewebsites.net/api/splitweights?mineralWeights=5,11,8,7,1,1
    ```

    This call should generate following output:

    ```text
    {"0": -1, "1": 1, "2": -1, "3": 1, "4": -1, "5": -1}
    ```

### Call the function and pass parameters in the request

1. In Visual Studio Code, select the Azure icon in the Activity bar, and expand **Resources -> \<subscription\> -> Function App -> \<your Function App name\> -> Functions**. Right-click  the `SplitWeights` function and select **Execute Function Now...**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-publish-qio-job-as-azurefunction/execute-function-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to execute the Azure Function via Visual Studio Code.":::

1. In the input field **Enter request body**, you'll see the request message body. Enter the value of `{ "mineralWeights": [5,11,8,7,1,1] }`. Press **Enter** to send this request message to your function.
1. The following confirmation message should appear after a few seconds:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-publish-qio-job-as-azurefunction/execute-function-2.png" alt-text="Screensshot of the confirmation message after the Azure Function call.":::

> [!TIP]
> The function you just deployed implements the *number partitioning problem*. It allows you to split a given set of numbers into two subsets with equal (or similar) sum of their elements. To learn more about this problem and its implementation, see the [MS Learn Module: Solve optimization problems by using quantum-inspired optimization](/training/modules/solve-quantum-inspired-optimization-problems/).

## Clean up resources

If you are done testing your Function App, you can use the following steps to delete it and its related resources from your Azure subscription to avoid incurring extra costs.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Home screen. In the **Resources** section on this page, select the resource group where you created the Function App. 
1. The following resource types were created automatically when you created the Function App:

    - a Function App
    - an Application Insights
    - an App Service Plan
    - a Storage account

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Your quantum workspace also has a storage account connected to it which you may not want to delete yet. To determine which storage account belongs to the quantum workspace, select the workspace resource and view the properties on the overview page. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-publish-qio-job-as-azurefunction/cleanup-resources.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure resources in a workspace.":::

1. Select the resources you want to delete and select **Delete**. Deletion may take a couple of minutes. When it's done, a notification appears. You can also select the bell icon at the top of the page to view the notification.

## Next steps

- Now that you know how to publish jobs as Azure Functions, you can try to publish other jobs from our [samples collection](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/tree/main/samples/azure-quantum) or try to publish your own job.
