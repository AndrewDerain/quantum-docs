# Quickstart: Run your first resource estimate

Learn how to use the Azure Quantum service to submit quantum programs to the [Azure Quantum Resource Estimator](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.resources-estimator). This example uses a Jupyter notebook in Azure Quantum and the built-in azure-quantum Python package - no installation or configuration is required. For more information about using Jupyter notebooks with Azure Quantum, see [Run Jupyter notebooks in an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.notebooks).

In this example, you'll run a sample notebook that estimates the costs of a multiplier on a fault-tolerant quantum computer written in Q# and Python.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you donâ€™t have an Azure account, register for free and sign up for a [pay-as-you-go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/).
- An Azure Quantum workspace. For more information, see [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).

## Enable the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator target in your workspace

First, you need to enable the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator as a provider in your workspace. The usage of the Azure Quantum Resources Estimator is free of charge.  
1. If you don't have an Azure Quantum workspace yet, or want to create a new one:
    1. Go to [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace) and follow the steps using the **Advanced create** option 
    2. During the workspace creation process, under **Providers**, select **Microsoft Quantum Computing**
    3. Select **Learn & Develop** and select **Save**
    4. Wait until the deployment of the workspace is complete

2. If you use an *existing* Azure Quantum workspace:
    1. Open your workspace in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) 
    2. On the left panel, under **Operations**, select **Providers** 
    3. Select **+ Add a provider** 
    4. Select **Microsoft Quantum Computing**
    5. Select **Learn & Develop** and select **Save**


## Copy a sample notebook

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select your Azure Quantum workspace.
1. Select **Notebooks**.
1. In the **Sample gallery**, navigate to the **Resource estimation** tab. 
1. Locate the **Estimates with Q# input** notebook tile, and select **Copy to my notebooks**.
1. The sample notebook can be found under **My notebooks** and you can now run the notebook.

### Stepping through the program 

The *Estimates with Q# input* program runs a multiplier and analyzes the physical resource estimates targeted on a fault-tolerant quantum computer.

- **1st and 2nd cell**: Preloads `qsharp` package and your subscription information to connect to the Azure Quantum service. 
- **3rd cell**: Selects the **Azure Quantum Resource Estimator** as target using the `microsoft.estimator` target ID and loads some required packages.
- **4th cell**: The Q# code that defines the quantum algorithm. It creates a multiplier using the [MultiplyI](/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.arithmetic.multiplyi) operation. You can configure the size of the multiplier with a `bitwidth` parameter. The operation will have two input registers with that bit width, and one output register with the size of twice the bit width.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The *%%qsharp* magic command allows you to enter Q# code directly into the notebook when using the **Python 3 (ipykernel)**. For more information, see [%%qsharp magic command](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.python-local#the-qsharp-magic-command).

- **5th and 6th cells**: Submits the quantum algorithm to the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator target using the `qsharp.azure.execute` function. You can create a new instance for a specific bit width, for example 8 in this case.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > To submit an Q# operation to the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator target, it can't take any input arguments and must have a `Unit` return value. 
   
- **8th cell**: Retrieves the results of the resource estimation job and shows a table with overall physical resource counts. You can further inspect cost details by collapsing the groups, which have more information. For example, if you collapse the *Logical qubit parameters* group, you can more easily see that the error correction code distance is 13. 

    |Logical qubit parameter| Value |
    |----|---|
    |QEC scheme                                                |                           surface_code |
    |ECC distance                                                                       |            13 |
    |Physical qubits                                                                   |            338 |
    |Logical cycle time                                                                   |   5us 200 ns |
    |Logical qubit error rate                                                            |     3.00E-9 |
    |Crossing prefactor                                                                    |       0.03|
    |Error correction threshold                                                             |      0.01|
    |Logical cycle time formula    | (4 * `twoQubitGateTime` + 2 * `oneQubitMeasurementTime`) * `codeDistance`|
    |Physical qubits formula	      |                                      2 * `codeDistance` * `codeDistance`|


    In the *Physical qubit parameters* group, you can see the physical qubit properties that were assumed for this estimation. 
    For example, see that the time to perform a single-qubit measurement and a single-qubit gate are assumed to be 100 ns and 50 ns, respectively.

    |Physical qubit parameter | Value |
    |---|---|
    |Qubit name     |                    qubit_gate_ns_e3 |
    |Instruction set                      |     GateBased  |
    |Single-qubit measurement time         |       100 ns |
    |T-gate time	                            |      50 ns|
    |T-gate error rate                       |      0.001 |
    |Single-qubit measurement error rate      |     0.001 |
    |Single-qubit gate time                    |    50 ns |
    |Single-qubit error rate                   |    0.001 |
    |Two-qubit gate time                       |    50 ns |
    |Two-qubit error rate                        |  0.001 |


For more information, see [the full list of output data](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.resources-estimator#output-data) of the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator.

- **From 9th cell to the end**: Changes the input parameters of the program and estimates the same quantum algorithm.

### Input parameters

There are three top-level input parameters that can be changed and passed via the `jobParams` argument to `qsharp.azure.execute`: `errorBudget`, which is the overall allowed error, `qecScheme`, which is the quantum error correction scheme, and `qubitParams`, which are the properties of the underlying physical qubits. For more information, see [Input parameters of Azure Quantum Resource Estimator](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.resources-estimator#input-parameters).

 In the **9th cell** of the notebook, you can see the defaults and access all the values that can be passed to a job execution.

```python
result['jobParams']
```
```output
{'errorBudget': 0.001,
 'qecScheme': {'crossingPrefactor': 0.03,
  'errorCorrectionThreshold': 0.01,
  'logicalCycleTime': '(4 * twoQubitGateTime + 2 * oneQubitMeasurementTime) * codeDistance',
  'name': 'surface_code',
  'physicalQubitsPerLogicalQubit': '2 * codeDistance * codeDistance'},
 'qubitParams': {'instructionSet': 'GateBased',
  'name': 'qubit_gate_ns_e3',
  'oneQubitGateErrorRate': 0.001,
  'oneQubitGateTime': '50 ns',
  'oneQubitMeasurementErrorRate': 0.001,
  'oneQubitMeasurementTime': '100 ns',
  'tGateErrorRate': 0.001,
  'tGateTime': '50 ns',
  'twoQubitGateErrorRate': 0.001,
  'twoQubitGateTime': '50 ns'}}
 ```
    

The Azure Quantum Resource Estimator offers [six pre-defined qubit parameters](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.resources-estimator#physical-qubit-parameters), four of which have gate-based instruction sets and two with a Majorana instruction set. In the **10th cell**, you can estimate the cost for the same algorithm using the Majorana-based qubit parameter, `qubitParams`, "qubit_maj_ns_e6".

```python
result = qsharp.azure.execute(EstimateMultiplication8,
            jobParams={
                "qubitParams": {
                    "name": "qubit_maj_ns_e6"
                }})
result
```

The pre-defined qubit parameters can also be customized by specifying the name and then updating the values of other fields. For more information, see [Custom pre-defined qubit parameters](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.resources-estimator#custom-pre-defined-qubit-parameters). 

Run the following cells of the notebook and learn how to customize the quantum error correction code (QED), `qecScheme`, and the error budget, `errorBudget`.

The full functionality of the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator is beyond the scope of this quickstart. For more information, see [How to submit jobs to the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator](xref:microsoft.quantum.submit-resource-estimation-jobs#resources-estimation-with-q-and-python).
