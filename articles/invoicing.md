# Invoicing and billing

Azure Quantum partners with 3rd party quantum hardware providers to offer a variety of quantum hardware and software solutions. This article is an overview of the invoicing and billing process for these providers.

For more information about the billing plans and pricing offer, see [Azure Quantum pricing](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers-pricing) page. 

## How to get your invoices

The invoices are sent to the email address you used to sign up for Azure Quantum. If you need to change the email address, contact [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/).

You receive a separate invoice for each quantum provider you use. The invoices from Azure Quantum 3rd party providers are of type **Azure Marketplace and Reservations**.

## What is included in your Azure Quantum invoice

The Azure Marketplace and Reservations invoices include spending against Azure 3rd party providers. Azure Quantum currently offers quantum hardware from IonQ, Quantinuum and Rigetti.

The Azure Marketplace and Reservations invoices **don't** include spending against first party Azure services, such as storage accounts attached to the Azure Quantum workspace. These typically represent very small amounts.

For more information about Azure infrastructure costs, see [Azure Blob Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/).

## How invoices are billed

The invoices are paid using the same payment method you use for the Azure subscription of your Azure Quantum workspace. You may have different payment methods for different subscriptions.

The invoices are billed in arrears. For example, the invoice you receive in January is for the usage you incurred in December.

## How to view your invoices

You can view your invoices in the Azure portal. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), using the credentials for your Azure subscription.
1. In the top search bar, type **Cost Management + Billing**.
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Invoices**.

In this view, you can see all your invoices. The invoices from Azure Quantum 3rd party providers are of type **Azure Marketplace and Reservations**.

You can filter by date, subscription, and status. You can also download the invoices as PDF files. You can see the invoice date and the billing period. Note that the billing period is not the same as the month in which you receive the invoice.
