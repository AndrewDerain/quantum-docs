> [!NOTE]
> First-time users automatically get free Azure Quantum Credits for use with each participating quantum hardware provider (500 USD each) when creating your workspace. Azure Quantum wonâ€™t start charging you once you reach your credit limit. If you have consumed all the credits and you need more, you can apply to the [Azure Quantum Credits program](https://aka.ms/aq/credits). For more information see [FAQ: Applications to the Azure Quantum Credits Program](xref:microsoft.quantum.credits.credits-faq).
