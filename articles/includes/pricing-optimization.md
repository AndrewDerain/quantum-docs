## Microsoft

Charges for the Microsoft QIO provider are based on the runtime of your optimization problem, in seconds. Per-second rates are based on the plan you select and the volume of optimization jobs you run within a month. For detailed Microsoft QIO pricing in your region, see [Microsoft Optimization Pricing Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-quantum/).
