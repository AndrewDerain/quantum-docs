> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (Classic QDK) will no longer be supported after June 30, 2024. If you are an existing QDK developer, we recommend that you transition to the new [Azure Quantum Development Kit (Modern QDK)](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview) to continue developing quantum solutions. For more information, see [Migrate your Q# code to the Modern QDK](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.migrate-code).
