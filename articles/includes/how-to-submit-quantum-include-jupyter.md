## Prerequisites

- An Azure Quantum workspace in your Azure subscription. To create a workspace,
  see [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).
- The latest version of the [Quantum Development Kit for Jupyter Notebooks](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview#use-q-and-python-with-jupyter-notebooks). This installs Jupyter Notebook and the IQ# kernel, which powers the Q# Jupyter Notebook and
Python experiences.

## Quantum computing with Q# Jupyter Notebooks

1. Run `jupyter notebook` from the terminal where your conda environment is
   activated. This starts the notebook server and opens Jupyter in a browser.
1. Create your Q# notebook (via **New** â†’ **Q#**) and write your Q# program.
1. Write your Q# operations directly in the notebook. Running the cells will
   compile the Q# code and report whether there are any errors.
    - For example, you could write a Q# operation that looks like this:

        ```qsharp
        operation GenerateRandomBit() : Result {
            use q = Qubit();
            H(q);
            let r = M(q);
            Reset(q);
            return r;
        }
        ```

1. Once you have your Q# operations defined, use the `%azure.*` magic commands
   to connect and submit jobs to Azure Quantum. You'll use the resource ID of
   your Azure Quantum workspace in order to connect. (The resource ID can be found
   on your workspace page in the Azure portal.)

   If your workspace was created in an Azure region other than \"West US\", you also
   need to specify this as the `location` parameter to `%azure.connect`.

    - For example, the following commands will connect to an Azure Quantum
      workspace and run an operation on the `ionq.simulator` target:

        ```py
        %azure.connect "/subscriptions/.../Microsoft.Quantum/Workspaces/WORKSPACE_NAME" location="West US"

        %azure.target ionq.simulator

        %azure.execute GenerateRandomBit
        ```

        where `GenerateRandomBit` is the Q# operation that you have already
        defined in the notebook.

1. After submitting a job, you can check its status with the command `%azure.status` or view
   its results with the command `%azure.output`. You can view a list of all your jobs with the command `%azure.jobs`.

Some helpful tips while using Q# Jupyter Notebooks:

- Use the command `%lsmagic` to see all of the available magic commands, including
  the ones for Azure Quantum.
- Detailed usage information for any magic command can be displayed by simply
  appending a `?` to the command, for example, `%azure.connect?`.

- Documentation for magic commands is also available online:
  [%azure.connect](/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.connect),
  [%azure.target](/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.target),
  [%azure.submit](/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.submit),
  [%azure.execute](/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.execute),
  [%azure.status](/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.status),
  [%azure.output](/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.output),
  [%azure.jobs](/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.jobs)
