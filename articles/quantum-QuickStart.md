Purpose of an Overview article: 
1. To give a TECHNICAL overview of a service/product: What is it? Why should I use it? It's a "learn" topic that describes key benefits and our competitive advantage. It's not a "do" topic.
2. To help audiences who are new to service but who may be familiar with related concepts. 
3. To compare the service to another service/product that has some similar functionality, ex. SQL Database / SQL Data Warehouse, if appropriate. This info can be in a short list or table.

## Conclusion

We have reviewed, in this brief introduction, how quantum computers can be viewed as a device that stores information as a unit vector in an exponentially large vector space and seen how quantum gates can be used to rotate these states in such a way as to perform a calculation.  We have also discussed useful language for describing quantum operations such as quantum circuits and Dirac notation which allow complex quantum states and subroutines to be quickly understood by a developer.

While these tools are foundational for any developer of quantum software, they by no means span the depth or breadth of what is known about quantum computer programming and algorithm design.  Since quantum computing remains a rapidly developing field, there is no one resource that has all of the information needed to learn how to best use these tools in order to solve problems.  For this reason we have compiled a list of references that may be of use for the interested reader who wishes to learn more about the art of quantum computer programming.
