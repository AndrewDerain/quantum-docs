# Getting Started with the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit #

A great way to get started with the Quantum Development Kit is via some of the Jupyter notebooks available in our [GitHub Quantum repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum.git). 
These notebooks can be launched directly in a web browser via [binder](https://mybinder.org/). In particular:

* **[Q# Notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/Quantum.git/master?filepath=Samples%2Fsrc%2FIntroToIQSharp%2FNotebook.ipynb)**: explains how to compile and simulate Q# operations inside a Jupyter notebook.
* **[Teleport](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/Quantum.git/master?filepath=Samples%2Fsrc%2FTeleportation%2FNotebook.ipynb)**: shows how to implement the teleport algorithm using Q#.

Be mindful that all changes you do to notebooks launched this way cannot be saved. In order 
to create new notebooks or write new quantum applications you will need to install 
IQ# to your local machine.


## Installing IQ# ##

IQ# (pronounced i-q-sharp) provides the core functionality of compiling and simulating Q# operations.
Installing IQ# on your machine typically takes less than 10 minutes; just follow these two steps:

1. Install the latest version of [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) (2.1 or later) by 
  following the instructions from the [.NET downloads page](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).
2. From the command line, execute:
   ```Command Prompt
   dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.Quantum.IQSharp
   ```

Your installation of the Quantum Development Kit is now complete!

To verify IQ# was correctly installed, from the command line type: `dotnet iqsharp --version`. You should see the IQ# version reported on the output, for example:
```
C:\>dotnet iqsharp --version
Language kernel: 0.5.1903.2501
Jupyter core: 1.1.12077.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> IQ# requires a 64-bit installation of Windows 10, macOS, or Linux.
>
> Microsoft's quantum simulator, installed with the Quantum Development Kit, utilizes Advance Vector Extensions (AVX), 
> and thus can run significantly more efficiently on an AVX-enabled CPU.
> The Quantum Development Kit will still run on nonâ€“AVX enabled CPUs, but may not be as efficient.
> Intel processors shipped in Q1 2011 (Sandy Bridge) or later support AVX.
>
> Microsoft's quantum simulator utilizes OpenMP at runtime, on Linux systems you might need to manually install `libgomp`.


## Classical Hosts ##

Applications developed with Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit typically consists of two parts:
1. One or more quantum algorithms, implemented using the Q# quantum programming language.
2. A classical program, implemented in a classical programming language like Python or C#, 
  that serves as the main entry point and will invoke Q# operations 
  when it wants to execute a quantum algorithm.

Once you have installed IQ#, these articles explain how to enable interoperability between Q# and other classical languages:

* [C# getting started](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.csharp)
* [Python getting started](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.python)
* [Jupyter notebooks getting started](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.jupyter)

## Editor extensions ##

The Quantum Development Kit offers extensions to [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) 
and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to improve the development experience. 
These extensions are available from [Visual Studio's Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) 
and provide features like:
* Code highlighting
* Errors highlights
* Documentation on hover
* Goto symbol definition
* Rename of symbols
* Debug breakpoints (Visual Studio)

To install the extensions, follow the instructions at:
