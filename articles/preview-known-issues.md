# Azure Quantum preview - Known issues

This document contains a list of known issues that we are working to address in the preview.

## List Jobs API returns all jobs

The List Jobs API currently returns all jobs and does not support pagination, which can make it very slow for Workspaces with a large number of jobs. This API will soon support pagination.

## Job management requests may take a long time

Occasionally, a request to the service for a job may take a long time to complete. If you experience this behavior, we recommend waiting briefly and then retrying the request.

## Cancelling a job may throw an exception in the SDK, but cancellation succeeds

If you attempt to cancel a job in any state, you may receive a local exception in the SDK but the cancellation of the job will still be processed.
