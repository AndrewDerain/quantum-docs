# Introduction to Azure Quantum (preview)

Azure Quantum is a Microsoft Azure service that developers, researchers, and businesses can use to run quantum computing programs or solve optimization problems in the cloud.

The Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK) consists of [Q#](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.q-sharp), Microsoftâ€™s open-source programming language for developing your quantum algorithms, in addition to libraries, APIs for Python and .NET languages, and a Python SDK for optimization solvers.

Azure Quantum offers you access to different providers of quantum computing devices and enables you to run your Q# quantum programs on real hardware, as well as the option to test your code on simulated quantum computers. Optimization algorithms are available to run on various classical computing silicon solutions, such as CPU, FPGA, GPU, or custom silicon.  For more information, see [Quantum computing targets](xref:microsoft.quantum.reference.qc-target-list) and [Optimization targets](xref:microsoft.quantum.reference.qio-target-list).

## Quantum computing

Quantum computing harnesses quantum mechanics to enable computations that can solve remarkably complex problems. Applied to areas such as financial services, machine learning, or chemistry and materials development, quantum computers can aid in development far beyond the capacity of present-day supercomputers. Researchers and businesses will have the ability to model complex scenarios in risk management, cybersecurity, vaccine development, and materials science.

To learn more about quantum computers and quantum algorithms see [Introduction to quantum computing](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.qdk-overview).  


## Optimization

Optimization is a class of computing problems that are primary candidates for running on quantum computers in the future, providing a quantum advantage over classical solutions. We can already accelerate optimization problems using Azure Quantum solvers that run on classical hardware in Azure today faster than many other classical optimization techniques.

Complex optimization problems exist across every industry, such as vehicle routing, supply chain management, portfolio optimization, power grid management, and many others. Optimization algorithms are also at the core of many machine learning methods. These real-world problems are very valuable to solve in order to reduce costs, accelerate processes, or reduce risk. 

Azure Quantum gives you access to a broad set of state-of-the-art optimization algorithms developed by Microsoft and its partners. You can use classic optimization algorithms inspired by standard physics, as well as [quantum-inspired optimization](xref:microsoft.quantum.optimization.overview.what-is-qio) algorithms (QIO). 

QIO uses algorithms that are based on quantum principles for increased speed and accuracy. Azure Quantum supports QIO to help developers leverage the power of new quantum techniques today without waiting for quantum hardware.

Optimization algorithms are available to run on various classical computing silicon solutions, such as CPU, FPGA, GPU, or custom silicon. For more information about optimization problems, see [Introduction to optimization](xref:microsoft.quantum.optimization.concepts.overview.introduction).
