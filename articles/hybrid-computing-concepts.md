# Hybrid quantum computing concepts

All quantum computing is hybrid in some sense. The earliest quantum systems used classical processes to send instructions to the quantum computer, and receive and process the resulting data. *Hybrid quantum computing* refers to the tight and symbiotic integration between classical and quantum processors, such that computations and results are shared back and forth in real time during the run of a program. The quantum computer does what it is good at, and the classical computer does what it is good at. Instead of the quantum computer eventually replacing the classical computer, they will more likely form a hybrid, high-performance system in the cloud.

This article describes three techniques - mid-circuit measurement, qubit re-use, and quantum error correction - that are necessary to make hybrid quantum computing possible.

## Mid-circuit measurement




## Qubit re-use and optimizing the number of qubits




## Error correction and fault tolerance

## Next steps
