# Overview of solvers

The Microsoft QIO provider comes with a variety of optimization solvers. These solvers solve problems on classical CPUs or on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA). The following table lists the solvers and provides a brief comparison between them.

| **Name** | **Description** | **Best applicable scenario** |
| - | - | - |
| Parallel tempering | Rephrases the optimization problem as a thermodynamic system and runs multiple copies of a system, randomly initialized, at different temperatures. Then, based on a specific protocol, exchanges configurations at different temperatures to find the optimal configuration. | <ul><li>Generally outperforms simulated annealing on hard problems with rugged landscapes</li><li> Very good at solving Ising problems</li></ul> |
| Simulated annealing | Rephrases the optimization problem as a thermodynamic system and considers the energy of a single system. Changes to the system are accepted if they decrease the energy or meet a criterion based on decreasing temperature. | <ul><li>Convex landscapes</li></ul> |
| Simulated quantum annealing | Similar to simulated annealing but the changes are by simulating quantum-tunneling through barriers rather than using thermal energy jumps. | <ul><li>Optimization landscape has tall and thin barriers</li><li>Due to its large overhead, is useful for small hard problems</li></ul> |
| Tabu search | Tabu search looks at neighboring configurations.  It can accept worsening moves if no improving moves are available  and prohibit moves to previously-visited solutions | <ul><li>Convex landscapes, high density problems, QUBO problems.</li></ul>

### FPGA vs. CPU

For some solvers we offer two versions: an unlabeled version that runs on traditional CPUs and a labeled FPGA version. In the following table you can see the pros and cons of using FPGA solvers:

| Pros/Cons | FPGA solvers |
| - | - |
| Pros | <ul><li>Highly parallel optimized, compared with CPU solvers, we witnessed about 100-200 times performance gain when the simulated annealing parameters settings are the same (restarts and sweeps).</li><li>FPGA solver use very condensed memory representation, so for problem with a large number of terms may fail CPU solver for OOM, but not for FPGA solver.</li></ul> |
| Cons | <ul><li>FPGA solver support upto 8192 variables, this is a hard limitation.</li><li>For best performance, FPGA solvers use 32 bits float point operations, because of this, the computation accuracy of FPGA solvers is a little lower than CPU solvers'.</li></ul>                                                                                                                 |

#### Recommendations for FPGA solvers 

FPGA solvers use the same parameters as their corresponding CPU solvers, but for the best performance, please tune the parameters of FPGA solvers, instead of just directly using CPU solvers' parameters. For example, in FPGA solvers, we build about 200 parallel pipelines, and each pipeline can handle one restart, so the restarts of FPGA shall be no less than 200.

FPGA solvers have an initialization time that may take a large percentage of the total runtime for small problems. If your problem can be solved on a CPU solver within a number of seconds, then you will likely not see a performance gain by switching to an FPGA. We recommend using FPGA solvers when the execution timing on CPU is at least a couple minutes.
