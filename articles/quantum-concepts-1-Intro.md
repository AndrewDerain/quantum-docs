Purpose of an Overview article: 
1. To give a TECHNICAL overview of a service/product: What is it? Why should I use it? It's a "learn" topic that describes key benefits and our competitive advantage. It's not a "do" topic.
2. To help audiences who are new to service but who may be familiar with related concepts. 
3. To compare the service to another service/product that has some similar functionality, ex. SQL Database / SQL Data Warehouse, if appropriate. This info can be in a short list or table.

# What is quantum computing?

A host of new computer technologies have emerged within the last few years, but quantum computing is the technology that  requires the greatest paradigm shift on the part of developers.  Quantum computers were proposed in the 1980s by Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin.  The intuition behind quantum computing stemmed from what was often seen as one of the greatest embarrassments of physics.  Quantum mechanics was developed between 1900 and 1925 and it remains the cornerstone on which chemistry, condensed matter physics and technologies ranging from from computer chips to LED lighting ultimately rests.  Yet despite these successes, even some of the simplest systems seemed to be beyond quantum mechanics power to explain.  This is because simulating systems of even a few dozen interacting particles  require more computing power than any conventional computer can provide over thousands of years.

There are many characteristics that make quantum mechanics hard to simulate.  The simplest is that quantum theory says that matter, at the quantum level, is simultaneously in many different possible configurations (known as states) at the same time.  Unlike classical probability theory, these potential configurations can interfere with each other like waves on the beach.  This interference prevents us from using statistical sampling to solve such problems and means that we have to track every possible configuration that a quantum system could be in if we want to understand its evolution.  Tracking every possible state requires that computer memory grow exponentially with the number of particles in the system. That means that a supercomputer simulating a system of 40 interacting electrons would need twice as much memory to simulate 41 interacting electrons.  At a few hundred electrons the memory required to store the system exceeds the number of particles in the universe and we lose all hope of simulating their quantum dynamics by adding more hardware.  And yet, in nature such systems evolve according to these laws regardless of our inability to model them.

This observation lead the creators of quantum computing to ask a question: can we turn this embarrassment into an opportunity?  Specifically, if quantum dynamics are hard to simulate what would happen if we were to build hardware that had quantum effects as fundamental operations?  Could we simulate systems of interacting particles using the same laws that govern them naturally? Could there be other tasks that are entirely absent from nature that such a device could speed up?  These questions were the genesis of quantum computing.

The core idea behind quantum computing is to store data in quantum states of matter and use quantum gate operations to bend quantum interference to our will and thereby use it to solve problems that would otherwise be beyond the reach of existing computers.  The first example of such an algorithm was Shor's algorithm for factoring, which promised to break the public key cryptosystems that keep e-commerce secure.  Further investigation revealed that simulating physical systems, search problems, solving systems of equations, and machine learning tasks can all be modeled using quantum operations.

Designing a quantum program to harness interference to solve problems may sound like a daunting challenge, and it is. Only a handful of basic strategies have been discovered that can manipulate quantum interference in a way that is useful for computing, and at the same time do not cause the data to be lost in a tangle of quantum possibilities that would be nearly impossible to measure, let alone understand.  Quantum programming is therefore a distinct art from classical programming and requires very different tools to understand and express quantum algorithmic thinking. Indeed, not having general tools to aid the quantum developer tackle such challenges is one of the biggest obstacles faced in quantum computer programming.

Q# was designed to address these challenges by providing a high-level programming language capable of quantum information processing while running on a software stack that enables a quantum algorithm to be compiled down to the primitive operations of a quantum computer.  Before approaching the programming language, it's helpful to review the basic principles on which quantum computing is based. We will take the fundamental rules of quantum computing to be axioms, rather than detailing their foundations in quantum mechanics. Additionally, we will assume basic familiarity with linear algebra (vectors, matrices etc) in our discussion.
