# Introduction to the Q# Standard Libraries

Q# is supported by a range of different useful operations, functions, and user-defined types that comprise the Q# *standard libraries*.
The [`Microsoft.Quantum.Sdk` NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Quantum.Sdk/) installed during [installation and validation](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview) automatically provides the Q# standard library.

The symbols defined by the Q# standard libraries are defined in much greater and more exhaustive detail in the [API documentation](xref:microsoft.quantum.apiref-intro).

In the following sections, we will outline the most salient features of each part of the standard library and provide some context about how each feature might be used in practice.
