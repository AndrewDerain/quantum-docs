# Installing and validating the Q# development environment

## Prerequisites

If you have [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) 2017 installed, you're ready to install the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit.

If you do not have Visual Studio installed, you can download Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition for free.
1. Go to the [Visual Studio download page](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
1. Click on the Visual Studio Community **Free download** button.
2. Navigate to your browser's download folder and double click on the executable file whose name begins with **vs_community**. The file name will contain a sequence of numbers that varies.
3. _**Important!**_ &nbsp;When you are presented with the option to select the tools for specific workloads, check the boxes for **Universal Windows Platform development** and **.NET desktop development**
4. After selecting your workloads, click **Install** to complete the installation.

## Creating the Q# development environment 

1. Install the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit

    1. Browse to the [Microsoft Quantum](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit) page and click the **Download now** button in the upper left.
    2. On the development kit [registration page](https://info.microsoft.com/QuantumComputingKitDownload-Registration.html), fill in the required information and press **Download now**.
    4. On the Visual Studio Marketplace [Quantum Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.DevKit) page, click **Download**. 
    8. Your browser will ask you whether you wish to **Open** or **Save** the download, click **Open**.
    9. Your security software may present a confirmation pane. Click **Allow**, or the comparable term used by your browser.
    10. The Quantum Development Kit extension will be installed in Visual Studio 2017.

## Validating your environment

In this section you will clone the quantum libraries, and run a sample application to verify that your Q# environment is correctly installed and configured. 

1. Clone the quantum Libraries repository.
    1. Browse to the [Libraries](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum) GitHub repository.
    2. Click the **Clone or download** button in the upper right.
    3. In the **Clone with HTTPS** pane, click **Open in Visual Studio**.
    4. If presented with a browser or virus checker confirmation pane, click on the "Allow" button (or comparable button in your environment.)
    5. Visual Studio will open with the **Team Explorer** pane open on the right.
    6. On the **Team Explorer** pane, click **Clone** to proceed.
    7. The repository will be cloned on your local computer and Visual Studio will switch to the **Solution Explorer** on the right populated with the libraries and samples.

2. Open the `Libraries\QsharpLibraries.sln` solution. 
    - If prompted by the **Install Missing Features** pane, click **Install** to allow the installation of the necessary features. This is most often F# and tools.

3. Validate your Q# environment by running the teleport sample program:
    
   1. Right click on the `TeleportationSample` project in `Samples` > `0.Introduction` folder of `QsharpLibraries` solution, and left click on "Set as Startup Project".
   2. Run the solution (F5.) If teleport runs and the output is similar to the following (has 8 rounds of successful teleportation with varying values True/False sent each round), your Q# environment is ready to support Q# development.

```
        Round 0:        Sent True,      got True. 
        Teleportation successful!!
        Round 1:        Sent False,     got False. 
        Teleportation successful!!
        ...
        Round 6:        Sent True,      got True. 
        Teleportation successful!!
        Round 7:        Sent False,     got False. 
        Teleportation successful!!
```
