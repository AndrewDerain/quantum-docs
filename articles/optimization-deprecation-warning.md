# Deprecation notice for optimization

**Important Update**: Quantum-inspired optimization solutions are no longer part of the Azure Quantum service after **June 30th, 2023**. The Microsoft QIO and 1QBit optimization solvers are deprecated and aren't available. You can still submit optimizations jobs to [Toshiba SQBM+](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers.optimization.toshiba) solver. 

> [!TIP]
> [Toshiba SQBM+](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers.optimization.toshiba) optimization provider is still available in Azure Quantum.

When you try to submit an optimization job to Microsoft QIO or 1QBit providers in Azure Quantum, you get the following error message:

```output
Error code: InvalidJobDefinition
Error message: The target specified does not exist or is not enabled for the workspace.
```

For further questions, you can contact [AzureQuantumInfo@microsoft.com](mailto:AzureQuantumInfo@microsoft.com).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have any questions or run into any issue using Azure Quantum, bookmark [Azure Quantum office hours](https://aka.ms/AQ/OfficeHours) and join our open office hours every Thursday 8âˆ¶30 AM Pacific Time zone (PT).
