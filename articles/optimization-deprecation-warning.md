# Important Update: Optimization Deprecation

Quantum-inspired optimization solutions are no longer part of the Azure Quantum service after **June 30th, 2023**. The Microsoft QIO and 1QBit optimization solvers are deprecated and aren't available.

You can still submit optimizations jobs to [Toshiba SQBM+](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers.optimization.toshiba) solver. 

For further questions, you can contact [AzureQuantumInfo@microsoft.com](mailto:AzureQuantumInfo@microsoft.com).
