# Overview

Primitive Depth Counter counts the of depth of
every operations invoked in quantum program. All operations from
`Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive` are expressed in terms of single qubit rotations,
T gate, single qubit Clifford gates, CNOT gate and measurements of multi-qubit
Pauli observables. User can set the depth for each of the primitive operations. By 
default all operations have depth 0 except T gate which has depth 1.This means 
that by default the T depth of operations is computed. Collected statistics
are aggregated over edges of operations call graph. Let us now compute T depth 
of CCNOT. We use the following Q# driver code: 

```qsharp
open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
operation CCNOTDriver() : () {
    body {
        using( qubits = Qubit[3] ) {
            CCNOT(qubits[0],qubits[1],qubits[2]);
            T(qubits[0]);
        } 
    }
}
```

# Using Depth Counter within C# program

To check that CCNOT has T depth 5 and `CCNOTDriver` has T depth 6
we can use the following C# code:

```csharp 
//using Microsoft.Quantum.Simulation.Simulators.QCTraceSimulators;
//using System.Diagnostics;
var config = new QCTraceSimulatorConfiguration();
config.useDepthCounter = true;
QCTraceSimulator sim = new QCTraceSimulator(config);
var res = CCNOTDriver.Run(sim).Result;

double tDepth = sim.GetMetric<Primitive.CCNOT, CCNOTDriver>(DepthCounter.Metrics.Depth);
double tDepthAll = sim.GetMetric<CCNOTDriver>(DepthCounter.Metrics.Depth);
```

First part of the program executes CCNOTDriver. In the second part we use method
`QCTraceSimulator.GetMetric` to get T depth of `CCNOT` and `CCNOTDriver`: 

```csharp
double tDepth = sim.GetMetric<Primitive.CCNOT, CCNOTDriver>(DepthCounter.Metrics.Depth);
double tDepthAll = sim.GetMetric<CCNOTDriver>(DepthCounter.Metrics.Depth);
```

Finally, co output all the statistics collected by depth counter in CSV format we can 
use the following:
```csharp
string csvSummary = sim.ToCSV()[MetricCalculatorsNames.depthCounter];
```
