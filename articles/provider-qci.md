# QCI provider

[!INCLUDE [Azure Quantum credits banner](includes/azure-quantum-credits.md)]

Quantum Circuits, Inc. ([QCI](https://quantumcircuits.com/)) originated out of the world-leading quantum computing research labs at Yale University in late 2015. QCI systems are based on a modular architecture that networks superconducting quantum processors, providing a robust and hardware-efficient approach that obtains more computational power with fewer elements.
