# Distributed hybrid computing

With fully integrated classical control and longer lived logical qubits, distributed quantum computing will enable real-time computations across quantum and distributed resources. The classical controls will no longer be limited to looping, and will allow for scenarios such as complex materials modeling or the evaluation of full catalytic reactions.
