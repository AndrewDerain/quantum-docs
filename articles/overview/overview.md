# Introduction to quantum computing 

There are some problems so difficult, so incredibly vast, that even if every supercomputer in the world worked on the problem, it would still take longer than the lifetime of the universe to solve.

Quantum computers hold the promise to solve some of our planet's biggest challenges - in environment, agriculture, health, energy, climate, materials science, and problems not yet even imagined. The impact of quantum computers will be far-reaching and have as great an impact as the creation of the transistor in 1947, which paved the way for today’s digital economy.

## What is quantum computing?

In modern usage, the word quantum means the _smallest possible discrete unit of any physical property_, usually referring to atomic or sub-atomic particles. Quantum computers use actual quantum particles – atoms or ions – as processing units, and are large, complex, and expensive devices. 

Harnessing the unique behavior of quantum physics and applying it to computational computing, quantum computers introduce new concepts to traditional programming methods, making use of quantum physics behavior such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference. 

## What can a quantum computer do?

A quantum computer isn’t a supercomputer that can do everything faster, it just does some select things extremely well. 

### Quantum simulation

Since quantum computers use quantum particles as their processors, they are well-suited for modeling other quantum systems. Photosynthesis, superconductors, and complex molecules are examples of quantum systems that can be simulated using quantum programs.

### Cryptography and Shor’s algorithm

In 1994, Peter Shor showed that a scalable quantum computer can break every widely used encryption technique. Classical cryptography relies on the intractability of operations on large numbers, such as factorization of large numbers into two prime numbers, and quantum computers excel at factorization. 

### Search and Grover’s algorithm

In 1996, Lov Grover developed a quantum algorithm that dramatically sped up the solution to unstructured searches faster than any classical algorithm can do. This increased speed becomes significant in lists that contain millions or billions of items.

### Optimization

Optimization is the task of balancing a system for maximum efficiency and minimum cost. A quantum computer can speed up optimization algorithms and find solutions that otherwise were not possible. In addition to optimizing traffic flow to reduce congestion, there is airplane gate assignment, package delivery, job scheduling and more. With breakthroughs in materials science, there will be new forms of energy, batteries with greater capacity, lighter and stronger materials.

### Machine Learning

A majority of numerical calculations in classical computing consists of solving linear systems of equations. This is especially true in the field of machine learning where most of the computation cost goes into calculating the inverse of huge matrices.

Fortunately, there is a quantum algorithm that allows us to approximate a solution exponentially faster than a classical computer. Reducing computation times in these areas will help address the energy crisis, climate change, food scarcity, and personal and precise medical diagnosis.

### Quantum-inspired computing

Quantum-inspired algorithms use quantum principles for increased speed and accuracy, but are implemented on classical computer systems.
For example, using algorithms developed by Microsoft’s quantum computing team, researchers at Case Western Reserve University have produced MRI scans that are up to three times faster than prior state-of-the-art approaches, as well as scans that are almost 30 percent more precise in measuring a key identifier of disease.

## Current advancements

Recently, Microsoft’s Quantum Lab located at the University of Sydney made breakthroughs in qubit control technology that allow them to scale beyond the physical limitations of current conventional systems. 

In 2019, Microsoft and IonQ, a quantum computer manufacturer, announced a partnership to make their laser-based quantum computers available to developers and researchers via the cloud. Users will be able to use Microsoft’s QDK and Q# to write quantum programs and run them on IonQ hardware. 

## Q# and the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK)

Q# is Microsoft’s open-source programming language for developing and running quantum algorithms. It is part of the QDK, a full-featured development kit for Q# that you can use with common tools and languages to develop quantum applications that you can run in various environments.
