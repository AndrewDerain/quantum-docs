<!-- General guidelines

    * DO:
        * Comment your code generously
        * Include a "Clean Up" section before the Summary section if an environment or configuration needs to be reset
    * DO NOT:
        * Include links to other content (such as our doc set or APIs) in the procedures. Explain everything that the user needs to know to do the task. This helps keep them focused and on task. EXCEPTION for the Prerequisites section for links to installation, configuration, etc.
        * Include a more Info, Resources, or See Also section
    * AVOID:
        * Notes, Tips, and Important boxes. Users find them distracting and generally skip over them. 
        * Excessive bulleted or numbered lists. Use only as needed for clarity.

# Tutorial: <verb and action> 
 <!-- (example) "Tutorial: Write and Simulate Qubit-level programs in Q#" -->

 <!-- 
    * Provide a high-level abstract of the tutorial: what the user will do, accomplish, and learn. "In this tutorial you will do..." 

    * Provide a bullet list of what is covered, based on the H2 procedure steps 
-->

 ## Prerequisites
 <!-- 
 Provide as necessary:
     * Software versions of installations
     * Previous tutorials or knowledge
     * Preparations such as creating a host project
-->

## Procedure_1 (Build the Scenario)
<!-- "This procedure walks you through writing the code to..."  -->

<!-- Include:
    * A short sentence or two describing what happens in this section
    * List and link the steps performed in this section
    * [optional] Display the finished and commented Q# code block. It can be beneficial to see the big picture first. 
-->

### Step_1 
<!-- Step names should describe an action, for example, "Add the Quantum.Operations namespace definition", "Measure the qubits and store the results">
<!-- Include
    * Brief description of what this step does
    * Individual steps as needed
    * Explain what this step accomplishes, what commands were used
    * Other pertinent notes or comments
-->
### Step_2

### Step_3

## Procedure_2 (Run the Scenario)
<!-- "This procedure walks you through running the code to..."  -->

<!-- Include:
    * A short sentence or two describing what happens in this section
    * (If more than 2 or 3 steps) List and link the steps performed in this section
-->
### Step_1
<!-- Include (as needed)
    * Brief description of what this step does
    * Individual steps as needed
    * Explain what this step accomplishes, what commands were used
    * Other pertinent notes or comments
-->
### Step_2

## Procedure_3 (Results)
<!-- "This procedure analyzes the output of the scenario..."  -->

<!-- Display the results and explain how they relate to the code and concept -->

## Procedure_4 (Variations and exercises)
<!-- As applicable, take advantage of the working environment the user just built to demonstrate variations of the scenario and to expand and reinforce learning, ie., "What if the input to X was negative?", "Replace <that code> with <this code> and compare the results" -->
### Step_1
<!-- Include (as needed)
    * Brief description of what this step does
    * Individual steps as needed
    * Explain what this step accomplishes, what commands were used
    * Other pertinent notes or comments
-->
## Summary
<!-- Review the scenario and highlight:
    * Key learning takeaways
    * Other possible applications of this knowledge
    * New concepts and commands introduced
-->

## Next Steps
<!-- Include one link only to:
    * The next logical tutorial in the series, or
    * Another related task that the user can do
