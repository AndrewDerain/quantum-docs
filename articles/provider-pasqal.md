# PASQAL provider

[!INCLUDE [Azure Quantum credits banner](includes/azure-quantum-credits.md)]

PASQAL's quantum computers control neutral atoms with optical tweezers, using laser light to manipulate quantum registers with up to a few hundred qubits.

- Publisher: [PASQAL](https://www.pasqal.com/)
- Provider ID: `pasqal`

The following targets available from this provider:

|Target name| Target ID|Number of qubits | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
|[Emu-Free](#simulators) | pasqal.sim.emu_free| 20 qubits |  |
|[Emu-TN](#simulators) | pasqal.sim.emu_tn| 100 qubits 1D network / 30-50 qubits 2D network| Simulates the time-evolution of a quantum state using the Schrodinger equation corresponding to the actions that the lasers perform. |
|[Fresnel1](#fresnel1) | pasqal.qpu.fresnel | 100 qubits | PASQAL's neutral atoms quantum computer. |

## Emulators

PASQAL's emulators programm run on cluster of 10 DGX nodes, each equipped with 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, allow the emulation of PASQALâ€™s quantum processors. A key tool to gain flexibility. Up to 100 qubits in 2D and 3D arrays can be emulated to develop industrial applications and to advance scientific discovery.

### Emu-Free

Accurately simulates the quantum dynamics of the neutral atoms powering the Pasqal quantum devices. Based on open-source libraries enhanced by Pasqal, it is capable of performing ideal simulations but also adding generic noise components. This feature allows it to more faithfully reproduce the outcome of a real Pasqal quantum processor. Currently, Emu-Free supports simulations up to 20 qubits.
