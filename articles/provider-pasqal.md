# PASQAL provider

[!INCLUDE [Azure Quantum credits banner](includes/azure-quantum-credits.md)]

PASQAL's quantum computers control neutral atoms with optical tweezers, using laser light to manipulate quantum registers with up to a few hundred qubits.

- Publisher: [PASQAL](https://www.pasqal.com/)
- Provider ID: `pasqal`

The following targets available from this provider:

|Target name| Target ID|Number of qubits | Description |

## Emulators

PASQAL's emulators run on cluster of 10 DGX nodes, each equipped with 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, allow the emulation of PASQALâ€™s quantum processors. A key tool to gain flexibility. Up to 100 qubits in 2D and 3D arrays can be emulated to develop industrial applications and to advance scientific discovery.

### Emu-Free

Accurately simulates the quantum dynamics of the neutral atoms powering the PASQAL quantum devices. Based on open-source libraries enhanced by PASQAL, it is capable of performing ideal simulations but also adding generic noise components. This feature allows it to more faithfully reproduce the outcome of a real PASQAL quantum processor. Currently, Emu-Free supports simulations up to 20 qubits.
