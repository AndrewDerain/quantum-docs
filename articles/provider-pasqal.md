# PASQAL provider

[!INCLUDE [Azure Quantum credits banner](includes/azure-quantum-credits.md)]

PASQAL's quantum computers control neutral atoms with optical tweezers, using laser light to manipulate quantum registers with up to a few hundred qubits.

- Publisher: [PASQAL](https://www.pasqal.com/)
- Provider ID: `pasqal`

The following targets available from this provider:

|Target name| Target ID|Number of qubits | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
|[Emu-TN](#emulator) | pasqal.sim.emu_tn| 100 qubits 1D network / 30-50 qubits 2D network| Simulates the time-evolution of a quantum state using the Schrodinger equation corresponding to the actions that the lasers perform. |
|[Fresnel1](#fresnel1) | pasqal.qpu.fresnel | 100 qubits | PASQAL's neutral atoms quantum computer. |

> [!NOTE]
> PASQAL quantum provider is currently available in Private Preview. You can request access to the Private Preview by following [this link](https://aka.ms/AQ/PrivatePreviewRequest). 

## Emulator

PASQAL's Emu-TN emulator run on cluster of 10 DGX nodes, each equipped with 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, allow the emulation of PASQALâ€™s quantum processors. A key tool to gain flexibility. Up to 100 qubits in 2D and 3D arrays can be emulated to develop industrial applications and to advance scientific discovery.

Emu-TN emulator simulates the time-evolution of a quantum state using the Schrodinger's equation corresponding to the actions that the lasers perform.
