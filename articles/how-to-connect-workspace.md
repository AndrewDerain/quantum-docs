# Connect to your Azure Quantum workspace

Once you have created an Azure Quantum workspace, you can connect to it using the `azure-quantum` Python package. The `azure-quantum` package provides a [`Workspace` class](xref:azure.quantum.Workspace) that represents an Azure Quantum workspace.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you donâ€™t have an Azure account, register for free and sign up for a [pay-as-you-go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go).
- An Azure Quantum workspace. See [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).
- Install the Azure Quantum `azure-quantum` package.
- If you use Azure CLI, you must have the latest version. For the installation instructions, see:

    - [Install Azure CLI on Windows](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows)
    - [Install Azure CLI on Linux](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux)
    - [Install Azure CLI on macOS](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-macos)


## Use a connection string to access your Azure Quantum workspace

You can use a connection string to specify the connection parameters to an Azure Quantum Workspace. You might use a connection string in the following scenarios:

- You want to share the workspace access with others who don't have an Azure account.
- You want to share the workspace access with others for a limited time.
- You cannot use Microsoft Entra ID due to company policies.

1. You can create a `Workspace` object by calling `from_connection_string`.

    ```python
    # Creating a new Workspace object from a connection string 
    from azure.quantum import Workspace 
    
    connection_string = "[Copy connection string]" 
    workspace = Workspace.from_connection_string(connection_string) 
    
    print(workspace.get_targets()) 
    ```

1. If you don't want to copy your connection string in the code, you can also store your connection string in an environment variable and use `Workspace()`.

    ```python
    # Using environment variable to connect with  connection string
    
    connection_string = "[Copy connection string from the portal]" 
    
    import os 
    
    os.environ["AZURE_QUANTUM_CONNECTION_STRING"] = connection_string 
    
    from azure.quantum import Workspace 
    
    workspace = Workspace() 
    print(workspace.get_targets()) 
    ```

> [!WARNING]
> Storing your account access keys or connection string in clear text presents a security risk and is not recommended. Store your account keys in an encrypted format, or migrate your applications to use Microsoft Entra authorization.


## Manage keys and connection strings

You can enable or disable **Access Keys** for your Azure Quantum workspace. Access keys are used to authenticate and authorize access to your Azure Quantum workspace. You can also regenerate new Access Keys to ensure the security of your workspace.

> [!TIP]
> Every Azure Quantum workspace has **primary and secondary** keys, and their corresponding connection strings. If you want to allow access to your workspace to others, you can share your secondary key and you use your primary for your own services. This way, you can replace the secondary key as needed without having downtime in your own services.

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

You can manage access keys and connection strings for your Azure Quantum workspace in the Azure portal.

#### Enable and disable access keys

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select your Azure Quantum workspace.
1. On the left panel, navigate to **Operations > Access keys**.
1. Switch the toggle under Access Keys to **Enabled** or **Disabled**.
1. Click on **Save** to save the changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When Access Keys is disabled, all request using connection strings or access keys are unauthorized. You can still use the workspace parameters to connect to your workspace.

#### Regenerate new access keys

If you suspect that your Access Keys have been compromised, or you want to stop sharing your workspace access with others, you can regenerate either the primary or secondary access keys, or both, to ensure the security of your workspace.

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select your Azure Quantum workspace.
1. On the left panel, navigate to **Operations > Access keys**.
1. **Access Keys** have to be enabled to regenerate new keys. If Access Keys are disabled, you need to enable them first.
1. Click on the **circular arrow icon** to regenerate the primary or secondary key.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

You can use the Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI) to manage access keys. For more information, see [Manage quantum workspaces with the Azure CLI](xref:microsoft.quantum.workspaces-cli).

1. Log in to your Azure account using the Azure CLI.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. Select the subscription you want to use. Replace `SubscriptionName` with your subscription name. You can also use the subscription ID instead of the subscription name.

    ```azurecli
    az account set --subscription SubscriptionName
    ```

1. Set the workspace you want to use. Replace `WorkspaceLocation`, `ResourceGroupName`, and `WorkspaceName` with your workspace location, resource group name, and workspace name, respectively.

    ```azurecli
    az quantum workspace set --location WorkspaceLocation --resource-group ResourceGroupName --workspace-name WorkspaceName
    ```

1. Show the **access keys** for the workspace.

    ```azurecli
    az quantum workspace keys list 
    ```

1. If you suspect that your access keys have been compromised, or you want to stop sharing your workspace access with others, you can **regenerate** either the primary or secondary access keys, or both, to ensure the security of your workspace.

    ```azurecli
    az quantum workspace keys regenerate --key-type Primary 
    az quantum workspace keys regenerate --key-type Secondary 
    az quantum workspace keys regenerate --key-type Primary,Secondary 
    ```

1. You can **enable and disable** the access keys for the workspace.

    ```azurecli
    az quantum workspace update --enable-api-key true 
    az quantum workspace update --enable-api-key false 
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When Access Keys is disabled, all request using connection strings or access keys are unauthorized. You can still use the workspace parameters to connect to your workspace.

## Use the workspace parameters to connect to your Azure Quantum workspace

Every Azure Quantum workspace has a unique set of parameters that you can use to connect to it. You can use the following parameters to connect to your Azure Quantum workspace:

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|`subscription_id`|The Azure subscription ID.|
|`resource_group`|The Azure resource group name.|
|`name`|The name of your Azure Quantum workspace.|
|`location`|The Azure region where the Azure Quantum workspace is provisioned. This may be specified as a region name such as "East US" or a location name such as "eastus".|
|`resource_id`|The Azure resource ID of the Azure Quantum workspace.|

You can find these parameters in the overview of your Azure Quantum workspace in  Azure portal. Follow these steps to connect to your workspace using the workspace parameters:

1. Log in to your Azure account, <https://portal.azure.com>,
1. Select your Azure Quantum workspace, and navigate to **Overview**. Copy the parameters in the fields. 

    ![How to retrieve the resource ID and location from an Azure Quantum workspace](media/azure-quantum-resource-id.png)

1. Create a `Workspace` object to connect to your Azure Quantum workspace. When creating a `Workspace` object, you have two options for identifying your Azure Quantum workspace:

    - Specify the location and resource ID (recommended): 

    ```python
    from azure.quantum import Workspace 

    workspace = Workspace(  
        resource_id = "", # Add the resource ID of your workspace
        location = "" # Add the location of your workspace (for example "westus")
        )
    ```

    - Specify the location, subscription ID, resource group, and workspace name: 
    
    ```python
    from azure.quantum import Workspace 

    workspace = Workspace(  
        subscription_id = "", # Add the subscription ID of your workspace
        resource_group = "", # Add the resource group of your workspace
        workspace_name = "", # Add the name of your workspace
        location = "" # Add the location of your workspace (for example "westus")
        )
    ```
