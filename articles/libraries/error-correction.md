## Error Correction ##

Qubits, by their very nature, are prone to errors. In classical systems we can create codes that allow us to recover from bit errors by using more physical bits to represent desired logical bits that are more resistant to errors (e.g., Hamming codes). The same is true in the case of quantum systems. In many cases the codes we need will have to be much more sophisticated and use many more physical qubits than the classical case to reach a desired level of fidelity.

The canon contains several examples of quantum codes that you can use as templates for your own work. These include encoders and decoders for:

- The Five Qubit Code (see: [Kliunchnikov and Maslov](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.08))
- The Seven Qubit CSS Steane Code (see: [Gottesman](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9705052))
- The Bit Flip code (see: [Criger, Moussa, and Laflamme]
