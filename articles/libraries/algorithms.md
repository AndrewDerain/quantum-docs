### Amplitude Amplification ###

Amplitude Amplification is one of the fundamental tools of Quantum Computing. There are many variants, but here we provide a very general version called Oblivious Amplitude Amplification with Partial Reflections to allow for the widest area of application. 

The general routine (`AmpAmpObliviousByReflectionPhases`) has two registers that we call `ancillaRegister` and `systemRegister`. It also accepts two oracles for the necessary reflections. The `ReflectionOracle` acts only on the `ancillaRegister` while the `ObliviousOracle` acts jointly on both registers. The input to `ancillaRegister` must be initialized to the unique -1 eigenstate of the first reflection operator $I-2|s{\rangle}{\langle}s|$. 

Typically, the oracle prepares the state in the computational basis $|0...0\rangle$. In our implementation, the `ancillaRegister` consistes of one qubit (`flagQubit`) that controls the `stateOracle` and the rest of the desired ancillas. The `stateOracle` is applied when the `flagQubit` is $|1\rangle$.

One may also provide oracles `StateOracle` and `ObliviousOracle` instead of reflections via a call to `AmpAmpObliviousByOraclePhases`. 

It is also worth noting that traditional Amplitude Amplification is just a speical case of these routines where `ObliviousOracle` is the identity operator and there are no system qubits (i.e., `systemRegister` is empty). If you wish to obtain phases for partial reflections (e.g., for Grover search), the function `AmpAmpPhasesStandard`. Please refer to `ExampleGrover.qb` for a sample implemetation of this.

We relate the single-qubit rotation phases to the reflection operator phases as described in the paper by [G.H. Low, I. L. Chuang](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05391). The fixed point phases that are used are detailed in [Yoder, Low and Chuang](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3305) along with the phases in [Low, Yoder and Chuang](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03996).

For background, you could start from [Standard Amplitude Amplification](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0005055) then move to an introduction to [Oblivious Amplitude Amplification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1414) and finally generalizations presented in [Low and Chuang](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06546). A nice overview presentation of this entire area (as it relates to Hamiltonian Simulation) was given by [Dominic Berry](http://www.dominicberry.org/presentations/Durban.pdf).

### Quantum Fourier Transform ###

The Fourier Transform is a fundamental tool of classical analysis and is just as important for quantum computations. In addition, the efficiency of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) far surpasses what is possible on a classical machine making it one of the first tools of choice when designing a quantum algorithm. 

As a generalization of the QFT, we provide an `ApproximateQFT` (AQFT) that allows for further optimizations by pruning rotations that aren't strictly necessary for the desired algorithmic accuracy. 

AQFT requires Z-rotation gates of the form $2\pi/2^k$ and Hadamard gates. The input and output are assumed to be encoded in big endian encoding (lowest bit/qubit is on the left, same as ket notation). The approximation parameter `a` determines the pruning level of the Z-rotations, i.e., $a \in [0..n]$. In this case all Z-rotations $2\pi/2^k$ where $k>a$ are removed from the QFT circuit. It is known that for $k >= log_2(n)+log_2(1/\epsilon)+3$ one can bound $||QFT-AQFT||<\epsilon$.

For more details, please refer to [M. Roetteler, Th. Beth](http://doi.org/10.1007/s00200-008-0072-2 ) and [D. Coppersmith](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201067).
