## Applications ##

### Hamiltonian Simulation ###

The modeling of Hamiltonians is one of the major application areas desired for Quantum Computing. We provide a simple example of this based on the experimental results reported in [O'Malley et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06860) using superconducting qubits. The model used for molecular hydrogen ($H_2$) only requires Pauli matrices and takes the form:

        $H = g_{0}\bold{1}+g_1{Z_0}+g_2{Z_1}+g_3{Z_0}{Z_1}+g_4{Y_0}{Y_1}+g_5{X_0}{X_1}$

We represent the target Hamiltonian as an expansion in a set of unitaries which allows the system to find a solution using either Trotter-Suzuki with Phase Estimation or a Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) with Amplitude Amplification. For an in-depth treatment of LCU, please refer to Chapter 2 of  [Robin Kohari's thesis](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/8625/Kothari_Robin.pdf). A nice overview of the area was presented by [Dominic Berry](http://www.dominicberry.org/presentations/Durban.pdf).

The $H_2$ example is an Effective Hamiltonian only representing the off-diagonal elements, requiring only 2 qubits. The constants $g$ are computed from the distance $R$ between the two Hydrogen atoms. 

Using canon functions, the Paulis are converted to Unitaries and then evolved over short periods of time, implementing Trotterization. This allows us to use a product of Unitaries (quantum circuit) to represent the sum of terms in the Hamiltonian. See `ExampleH2.qs` for how this is done.

The solution for the Hamiltonian ground state is found by utilizing Phase Estimation (described earlier) from the canon.

To demonstrate the solution, a top level driver program (`H2SimulationExample`) is provided which performs a plot of the resulting ground state energy for several bond lengths $R$ using the `FSharp.Charting` package and is shown along with the theoretical values.
