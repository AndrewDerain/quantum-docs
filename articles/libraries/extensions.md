## Extension Functions ##

In addition, the prelude defines a rich set of mathematical and type conversion functions at the .NET level for use within Q# code.
For instance, the @"microsoft.quantum.extensions.math" namespace defines useful operations such as @"microsoft.quantum.extensions.math.sin" and @"microsoft.quantum.extensions.math.log".
An individual target machine may override these operations with versions that are more efficient for that particular system.
