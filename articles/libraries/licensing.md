# Licensing 

The canon is an extensive collection of library functions and is open source, licensed under the permissive MIT license. It can be obtained from [Github Quantum Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum). 

It should be noted that Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit also provides a few specialized library functions that are licensed under a Microsoft Research license which is permissive for academic use, but which restricts commercial use. These library functions can be obtained from [Github Quantum-NC Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum-nc).
