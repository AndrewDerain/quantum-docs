# Higher-Order Control Flow #

<!--
    FIXME: Some of the functionality here has not been implemented yet.
-->

One of the primary roles of the canon is to make it easier to express high-level algorithmic ideas as quantum programs.
Thus, the Q# canon provides a variety of different flow control constructs, each implemented using partial application of functions and operations.
Jumping immediately into an example, consider the case in which one wants to construct a "CNOT ladder" on a register:

```qsharp
let nQubits = Length(register);
CNOT(register[0], register[1]);
CNOT(register[1], register[2]);
// ...
CNOT(register[nQubits - 2], register[nQubits - 1]);
```

We can express this pattern by using iteration and `for` loops:

```
for (idxQubit in 0..nQubits - 2) {
    CNOT(register[idxQubit], register[idxQubit + 1]);
}
```

Expressed in terms of <xref:microsoft.quantum.canon.applytoeachac> and array manipulation functions such as <xref:microsoft.quantum.canon.zip>, however, this is much shorter and easier to read:

```qsharp
ApplyToEachAC(CNOT, Zip(register[0..nQubits - 2], register[1..nQubits - 1]));
```

In the rest of this section, we will provide a number of examples of how to use the various flow control operations and functions provided by the canon to compactly express quantum programs.

## Applying Operations and Functions over Arrays and Ranges ##

One of the primary abstractions provided by the canon is that of iteration.
For instance, consider an unitary of the form $U \otimes U \otimes \cdots \otimes U$ for a single-qubit unitary $U$.
In Q#, this might get represented as a `for` loop over a register:

```
/// # Summary
/// Applies $H$ to all qubits in a register.
operation HAll(register : Qubit) : () {
    body {
        for (idxQubit in 0..Length(register) - 1) {
            H(register[idxQubit]);
        }
    }
    adjoint auto
    controlled auto
    adjoint controlled auto
}
```

We can then use this new operation as `HAll(register)` to apply $H \otimes H \otimes \cdots \otimes H$.

This is cumbersome to do, however, especially in a larger algorithm.
Moreover, this approach is specialized to the particular operation that we wish to apply to each qubit.
We can use that [operations are first-class](../quantum-techniques-2-operationsandfunctions#operations-and-functions-as-first-class-values) to express this algorithmic concept more explicitly:

```
ApplyToEachAC(H, register);
```

Here, the suffix `AC` indicates that the call to `ApplyToEach` is itself adjointable and controllable.
Thus, if `U` supports `Adjoint` and `Controlled`, the following lines are equivalent:

```
(Adjoint ApplyToEachAC)(U, register);
ApplyToEach((Adjoint U), register);
```

In particular, this means that calls to `ApplyToEachAC` can appear in operations which declare `adjoint auto`.
