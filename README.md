# Azure Quantum documentation

Welcome to Azure Quantum! This is the public repository for the Azure Quantum documentation.

This repository contains open-source documentation articles.  The main folder is **[articles/](./articles)** and contains the Markdown articles and YAML files that constitute the source of the [Azure Quantum documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/).

> :warning: If you want to modify an article of the API reference, **DO NOT** modify files in this repository. The API files are automatically generated from the comments in the language source code files, which are located in the [Quantum Libraries](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries) and [Q# runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime) repositories. To modify an article, you should locate the original source file, apply the changes in the comments there, and submit the pull request to its respective repository.
> For more information, see [Improving the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/contributing-docs).

> :pencil: If your changes are only editorial, without association to the API, this is the right place to do it. You can directly edit 
> the `*.md` and `*.yml` files here. You can also submit minor changes directly through the documentation page. For more information, see [Quick edits to documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/#quick-edits-to-documentation).
