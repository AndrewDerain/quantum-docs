    "# Job Shop Scheduling Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Job shop scheduling is a common and important problem in many industries. For example, in the automobile industry manufacturing a car involves many different types of operations which are performed by a number of specialized machines - optimizing the production line to minimize manufacturing time can make for significant cost savings. \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a superset of the travelling salesman's problem, which we know is NP-Hard. \n",
    "\n",
    "The job shop scheduling problem is defined as follows: we have a set of jobs $J_1, J_2, J_3,\\dots, J_n$ which have various processing times and need to be processed using a set of machines $m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_n$. The goal is to complete all jobs in the shortest time possible. \n",
    "Each job consists of a set of operations, and the operations must be performed in the correct order to complete that job. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine, for example, that we have a to-do list. Each item on the list is a **job** using our new terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each job in this list consists of a set of operations, and each operation has a processing time. We also have some tools at hand that we can use to complete these jobs (our **machines**).\n",

    "2. Each tool (**machine**) can only do one thing at a time. We can't simultaneously print two receipts unless we invest in multiple printers. This is the **no overlap constraint**.\n",

This makes this problem a **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)** problem, which is a specific subset of **Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO)** problems (which allow for higher-order polynomial terms than quadratic). Fortunately for us, the Azure Quantum Optimization service is set up to accept PUBO (and Ising) problems, which means we don't need to modify our representation to fit the solver.\n",
