    "# Job Shop Scheduling Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Job shop scheduling is a common and important problem in many industries. For example, in the automobile industry manufacturing a car involves many different types of operations which are performed by a number of specialized machines - optimizing the production line to minimize manufacturing time can make for significant cost savings. \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a superset of the travelling salesman's problem, which we know is NP-Hard. \n",
    "\n",
    "The job shop scheduling problem is defined as follows: we have a set of jobs $J_1, J_2, J_3,\\dots, J_n$ which have various processing times and need to be processed using a set of machines $m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_n$. The goal is to complete all jobs in the shortest time possible. \n",
    "Each job consists of a set of operations, and the operations must be performed in the correct order to complete that job. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine, for example, that we have a to-do list. Each item on the list is a **job** using our new terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each job in this list consists of a set of operations, and each operation has a processing time. We also have some tools at hand that we can use to complete these jobs (our **machines**).\n",
    "\n",
    "TODOs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pay electricity bill\n",
    "  1. Log in to site (*2 minutes*)\n",
    "  2. Pay bill (*1 minute*)\n",
    "  3. Print receipt (*3 minutes*)\n",

    "But we have some constraints:\n",
    "1. Each of the tasks (**operations**) in a todo (**job**) must take place in order. We can't print the receipt before we have made the payment! This is called a **precedence constraint**.\n",
    "2. Each tool (**machine**) can only do one thing at a time. We can't simultaneously print two receipts unless we invest in multiple printers. This is the **no overlap constraint**.\n",
    "3. We start an operation only once, and once started it must be completed before we do anything else. We don't tolerate procrastination in this shop! This is called the **operation once constraint**."

    "## Cost Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will spend the rest of this sample constructing what is known as a **cost function**, which is used to represent our problem. It is this cost function which we will submit to the Azure Quantum Optimization solver. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each point on a cost function represents a different solution configuration - in our case, each configuration is a particular assignment of starting times for the operations we are looking to schedule. The goal of the optimization is to minimize the cost of the solution - in this instance we wish to minimize the amount of time taken to complete all operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately for us, the solvers can't accept our problem in its native configuration - instead we need to represent our optimization task in a specific way that the solvers are able to deal with. We do this by creating an n-dimensional matrix of `Term`s representing the various possible solution configurations, and add penalties to terms that break our constraints - this increases the relative cost of those configurations and thus makes it unlikely that the optimizer will settle for these sub-optimal solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to make these invalid solutions so expensive that the solver can easily locate valid, low-cost solutions by navigating to valleys in the cost function. However, we must also ensure that these solutions are not so expensive as to create peaks in the cost function that are so high that our solver can't navigate past them to discover better optima."

    "\n",

This makes this problem a **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)** problem, which is a specific subset of **Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO)** problems (which allow for higher-order polynomial terms than quadratic). Fortunately for us, the Azure Quantum Optimization service is set up to accept PUBO (and Ising) problems, which means we don't need to modify our representation to fit the solver.\n",

    "\n",
    "As seen previously, we want to assign a penalty whenever the sum of $x_{i,t}$ values across all possible $t$ values is not equal to 1. This is how we represent that mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(x) = \\sum_{i} \\left(\\left(\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\\right) - 1\\right)^2$$\n",

    "\n",
    "- $\\left(\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\\right) - 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "  As we saw in the sum row of the tables in the worked example, $\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}$ should always equal exactly 1 (meaning that an operation must be scheduled **once and only once** during the simulation). This means that $\\left(\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\\right) - 1$ should always give 0. This means there is no penalty assigned when the constraint is not violated.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In the case where $\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t} > 1$ (i.e. an operation is scheduled to start more than once, like in the second example above), we now have a positive, non-zero penalty term as $\\left(\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\\right) - 1 > 0$ now.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In the case where $\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t} = 0$ (i.e. an operation is never scheduled to start, like in the last example above), we now have a $-1$ penalty term as $\\left(\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\\right) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\left(\\sum\\dots\\right)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "  Because our penalty terms must always be positive (otherwise we would be *reducing* the penalty when an operation isn't scheduled), we must square the result of $\\left(\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\\right) - 1$\n",
    "  \n",

    "&=\\left(x + y - 1\\right)^2\n",
