# Targets

The following targets are available from this provider:
- [QPU: Trapped ion quantum device](#Tapped-Ion-Quantum-Device)
- [Simulator: IonQ quantum simulator](#IonQ-Quantum-Simulator)

## QPU: Trapped Ion Quantum Device

IonQâ€™s trapped ion quantum computers perform calculations by manipulating
charged atoms held in a vacuum with lasers. This target operates in a
**No control flow** profile, meaning that it can't use results from
qubit measurements to control the execution flow.
